# Changelog for the PR pipeline convention

## 1.1.1 - 2026-10-04

Fixes to the runner and reader. `version` stays 1.

- A `no-pr` trigger stop on `pull_request` posts neutral `untrusted-trigger` on the event's head
  SHA instead of no check. Three runs post no check: a fork PR, a `pull_request` event sent by the
  lanes App, and a run on any other event whose run job gated no head SHA.
- With an activity requested, `resolve-config` decides only that slot's `applies-when`, so another
  slot's undecidable predicate no longer fails the run; the other slots carry `applies` null.
- A requested lane the config lacks is rejected as `undefined-lane`, not `undefined-activity`.
- The run job's unused `applies` output is removed.
- `select-trusted-text` takes the job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` for a `read` activity, as the runner already
  passed it; that token has no `issues` grant.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-10-04

Additive, except one tightening: the activity names `run` and `report` are now rejected.
`version` stays 1.

- Activities take optional `model` and `max-turns` (skill activities only); `args` now applies to
  `script` activities too.
- Skip reasons gain `untrusted-trigger` and `not-applicable`; the schema's `$defs/skip-reason`
  holds the full set. Fork PRs, `pull_request` events sent by the lanes App, a `no-pr` run with no
  head SHA, and a run on any other event whose run job gated no head SHA post no check.
- A lane is one workflow with one model job; scripted jobs beside it report its check runs.
- Mechanical and judgment `verify` lanes start together; a failed mechanical gate cancels the
  judgment lanes.
- The config path is the reader's `config-path` input, read at the base SHA, with its basename and
  location constrained; the vocabulary is read from the base SHA's synced copy.
- Each lane's stage, forbidden effects and gating, and "never" rule move to
  `.github/actions/resolve-config/lane-rules.json`, and each effect's App token grant is in
  `effect-grants.json` beside it.
- The reader rejects any `extends:` value and the activity names `run` and `report`.
- `resolve-config` outputs the selected activity's `gating`.
- An activity that runs head code (tests, linters, builds) takes effect `read`; a write-effect
  activity must not execute head code.
- A `gate` skill activity must not execute head code; gating tests, linters and builds run as a
  `script` activity.
- The example config drops the `format` slot (`toolchain:lint --fix`, `mutate-branch`), which ran
  head code with a write token, and disables the `fix-ci` slot for the same reason until a split
  design exists.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-10-03

Initial contract: pipeline stages and their order, lane boundaries, the activity contract, slot
ordering, outputs and skip reasons, merge rungs, loop caps, and the config schema.
