# Claude Code Skills in Cursor

When a **skill reference** is detected (by name, path, or implied usage):

## Locate the Skill

Skills may be in the project OR in user-installed plugins:

1. **Project skills**: Check project's `skills/` or `.claude/skills/` directories
2. **Plugin skills**: Check `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/{marketplace}/{plugin}/skills/`
3. Find the skill's `SKILL.md` file
4. Load any referenced context files or documentation
5. If files are @-referenced, read them in full
6. For scripts, understand the public API

**See `claude-code-plugins.mdc` for plugin directory structure and installation locations.**

## Execute the Workflow

1. **Follow the documented workflow literally** - respect phases (gather, analyze, execute, verify) and safety rules
2. Use local tools (git, tests, scripts) for gather/verify steps
3. Propose concrete commands and edits for execute steps

## Precedence

- Skill workflows take precedence over generic rules **within the skill's scope**
- Global safety rules ("NEVER" rules) always apply
- When in doubt, the skill's documentation is authoritative for that skill's domain
