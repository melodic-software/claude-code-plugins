# Git Commit Attribution

When creating git commits via Cursor, include this attribution:

```text
Generated with [Cursor](https://cursor.com)

Co-Authored-By: Cursor <noreply@cursor.com>
```

If other AI tools are used in the same repository, each tool should use its own attribution when it creates commits.
