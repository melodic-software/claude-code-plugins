# Official Documentation First

When working with frameworks, libraries, or platform-specific features, consult official documentation before making changes.

## Workflow

1. **Check docs first**: Before implementing, find and read relevant official documentation
2. **Base decisions on docs**: Don't guess at APIs, patterns, or best practices
3. **Follow documented patterns**: Use examples and structures from official sources
4. **Verify against current docs**: Documentation changes - ensure your approach is up to date

## Documentation Skills

Some ecosystems have dedicated skills for accessing official documentation:

| Ecosystem | Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Claude Code | `docs-management` | Official Claude Code documentation |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-cli-docs` | Official Gemini CLI documentation |

*Future ecosystems (OpenAI/Codex, etc.) may have similar documentation skills.*

When a documentation skill exists for the ecosystem you're working with, use it to access canonical, up-to-date documentation.

## When to Apply

- Implementing framework-specific features
- Using library APIs or SDKs
- Configuring platform settings
- Working with integrations or plugins
- Any feature where official guidance exists

## Exception

If official documentation is unavailable or incomplete, document assumptions clearly and note the gap for future reference.
