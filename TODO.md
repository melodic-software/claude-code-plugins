- `cursor` - encapsulates any and all information, setup, config, integration with Claude Code and Cursor (uses MCP, web search, real time doc fetching) - could be expanded to have its own local cached copies of docs from multiple sources like we do with docs-management and the google gemini CLI docs skills.
