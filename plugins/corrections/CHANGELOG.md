## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added

- `scripts/prove-check.sh --check '<command>' --old <ref> [--new <ref>]`: runs a proposed check in
  temporary worktrees at two refs and exits 0 only when it fails at the old ref and passes at the new
  one (default `HEAD`); exit 1 when the proof fails, 2 on a usage error. Both worktrees are removed on
  every exit path.
- `scripts/prove-check.test.sh`: five cases against a fixture repository with a planted violation.
