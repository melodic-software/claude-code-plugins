## [0.1.0]

### Added

- `sprite`, `animate` and `scene` skills: brief, author, render, review loop, deliver.
- `scripts/render.py`: standard-library renderer from a palette-locked spec to a 1x sheet PNG,
  an upscaled preview, one looping GIF per animation, and frame data in the Aseprite json-hash shape.
- `scripts/embed.py` inlines sprite specs into a scene template; `scripts/gallery.py` writes a
  preview page for an output directory.
- Reference files: static and animation craft rules, tiles, engine layouts (RPG Maker MZ, Aseprite,
  Godot, PICO-8, Pyxel), HTML Canvas scene rules, and the backend contract.
- `output_dir` and `backend` settings.
