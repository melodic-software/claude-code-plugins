## Key Concepts from This Lesson

### Meta-Prompts

A meta-prompt is a prompt that builds another prompt. Used to generate comprehensive plans from simple high-level descriptions.

### Higher-Order Prompts (HOPs)

Prompts that accept other prompts as input, enabling powerful prompt composition where plans are passed into implementation commands.

### Templates

Reusable prompt structures that encode engineering best practices for chores, bugs, features, and other classes of work.
