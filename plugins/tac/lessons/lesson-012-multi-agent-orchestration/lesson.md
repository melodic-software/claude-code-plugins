## Overview

Scale your agentic engineering with the one agent to rule them all: The Orchestrator Agent. Command fleets of specialized agents through a single interface with CRUD operations and real-time observability. Get ahead of the next paradigm in Agentic Coding.

## Key Concepts

### The Agent Evolution Path

Base agents -> Better agents -> More agents -> Custom agents -> Orchestrated agents. Each step scales your compute to scale your impact.

### Orchestrate to Scale

Command your fleet of agents using the single interface pattern. The rate at which you create and command agents becomes your engineering output constraint.

### The Single Interface Pattern

Talk to one orchestrator agent that creates, commands, and deletes specialized agents. One interface to rule them all.

### The Three Pillars of Multi-Agent Orchestration

1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Unified interface for commanding all agents
2. **CRUD for Agents** - Create, Read, Update, Delete agents at scale
3. **Observability** - Real-time monitoring of performance, costs, and results

### Observability Is Key

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. If you can't measure it, you can't scale it. Multi-agent observability is essential for success.

### Managing The Core Four At Scale

Track context windows, models, prompts, and tools for every agent you spin up. Adopt your agent's perspective multiplied across your fleet.

## Architectural Patterns

### Stay Out The Loop With Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent orchestration is an out-loop PETER system:

- **P**rompt input
- **T**rigger (HTTP)
- **E**nvironment
- **R**eview (observability)

Compound your engineering leverage.

### One Agent, One Prompt, One Purpose

Each specialized agent serves one purpose with a focused context window, produces concrete results, then gets deleted. Keep agents lean and focused.

### R&D Framework For Multi-Agent Context

Reduce unnecessary context in your primary orchestrator, Delegate work to specialized sub-agents with focused context windows. Context mastery at scale.

## Summary Table

| Pillar | Purpose | Key Benefit |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Orchestrator Agent | Unified interface | Single point of command |
| CRUD Operations | Agent lifecycle management | Scale agent creation/deletion |
| Observability | Real-time monitoring | Measure to improve |
