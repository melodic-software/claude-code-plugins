## Key Concepts from This Lesson

### The Two Layers of Modern Engineering

| Layer | Focus | Investment |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| Agentic Layer | AI workflows, prompts, plans | 50%+ time |
| Application Layer | DevOps, infra, database, code | <50% time |

### Minimum Viable Agentic Layer

1. AI Developer Workflow Directory
2. Prompts (stored in .claude commands)
3. Plans (templates for problem classes)

### The Parabolic Value Curve

- Early investment: Low immediate returns
- Continued investment: Exponential value growth
- 10 minutes input -> 2+ hours output

### All 8 Tactics Summary

| Lesson | Tactic | Core Idea |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 1 | Stop Coding | Let agents handle implementation |
| 2 | Adopt Agent's Perspective | Think like your agent |
| 3 | Template Your Engineering | Plan and structure before execution |
| 4 | Stay Out The Loop | Build AFK agents with PITER |
| 5 | Always Add Feedback Loops | Test and validate continuously |
| 6 | One Agent, One Prompt, One Purpose | Specialize and focus |
| 7 | Target Zero-Touch Engineering | Minimize human touchpoints |
| 8 | Prioritize Agentics | 50%+ time on agentic layer |

### The Irreplaceable Engineer

The irreplaceable engineer in phase 2 of the Generative AI age:

- Operates primarily on the agentic layer
- Solves problem classes, not one-offs
- Builds composable primitives
- Invests in meta-engineering
- Ships through agents, not manual coding
