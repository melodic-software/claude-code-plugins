## Overview

The prompt is the fundamental unit of engineering in the age of agents. Every prompt you create becomes a force multiplier - one well-crafted prompt can generate tens to hundreds of hours of productive work.

## Key Concepts

### The Prompt is the Fundamental Unit of Engineering

The prompt is now the fundamental unit of engineering. With agents, every prompt you create becomes a force multiplier. One well-crafted prompt can generate tens and hundreds of hours of productive work.

### The Stakeholder Trifecta

Engineering for three audiences: you, your team, and your agents. This is the stakeholder trifecta for the age of agents. The agentic shift that most engineers haven't yet made.

### Build Libraries of Reusable Battle-Tested Prompts

The winners are building libraries of reusable battle-tested agentic prompts with composable sections that work like lego blocks. You can swap these in and out to scale your engineering impact with compute.

### ZTE: The North Star of Agentic Coding

ZTE is the North Star of agentic coding. You want to be handing off more work to compute and setting up systems that trigger your workflow so your presence isn't needed. Building AFK agents.

### The Prompt is Everything

The prompt is everything. Context engineering is incredibly important, but we can't forget about the underlying skill that dictates everything - the prompt, and now the agentic prompt.

### Learning to Communicate to the Trifecta

What we're doing here is learning how to best communicate what we want to the trifecta: you, your team, and your agents. Let's level up our agentic prompt engineering abilities.

### Three Times Marks a Pattern

Whenever you start doing repeat work, hand it off to your agent. Three times marks a pattern - copy whatever you're doing and write it as a high level prompt, then move up the levels from there.

## The Seven Levels of Agentic Prompts

### Level 1: High Level Prompt

The reusable ad hoc static prompt. This is the one-off that you throw into a file as soon as you start repeating work that your agent can do without a problem. Contains 1-3 sections: Title and high level prompt.

### Level 2: Workflow Prompt - The Game Changer

A huge milestone. The workflow prompt represents a sequential workflow with additional sections. The workflow section is S-tier usefulness - the most important section. It's a sequential list of tasks for your agent to execute.

### Level 3: Control Flow

Building on workflow sections with flow control. At this level, we have flow control and are building customizable agents for domain-specific use cases. Continue building on that workflow section.

### Level 3-4: The 80/20

For most practical applications, level three, level four is all you need. These levels provide the foundation for effective agentic engineering without overwhelming complexity.

### Level 4: Delegation Prompt

The delegate prompt - a prompt that kicks off other workflows. This handles delegation to multiple agents while properly communicating to the trifecta (you, your team, and your agents).

### Level 5: Higher Order Prompts

An interesting concept discussed in TAC and used quite a bit. This is the perfect prompt passing prompts into prompts. You can maintain the higher order prompt and change and swap out the lower order prompts as needed.

### Level 6: Template Meta Prompt

A prompt used to create another prompt in a specific pattern. This is at level six for a reason and is essential for advanced agentic engineering. Meta-prompts that generate other prompts.

### Level 7: Self-Improving Prompt

Agents updating agents through prompts updating prompts. The highest level where the system becomes self-modifying and self-improving. This represents the pinnacle of agentic prompt engineering.

## Seven Levels Summary Table

| Level | Name | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | High Level Prompt | Simple reusable static prompt |
| 2 | Workflow Prompt | Sequential task list (game changer) |
| 3 | Control Flow | Conditional logic and branching |
| 4 | Delegation Prompt | Kicks off other workflows |
| 5 | Higher Order Prompts | Prompts passing prompts |
| 6 | Template Meta Prompt | Prompts that generate prompts |
| 7 | Self-Improving Prompt | Self-modifying systems |

## The 80/20 Rule

Levels 3-4 cover 80% of practical use cases. Don't over-engineer - start simple and add complexity only when needed.
