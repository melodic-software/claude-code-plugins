## Key Concepts from This Lesson

### The Stakeholder Trifecta

| Stakeholder | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| You | Your personal productivity and understanding |
| Your Team | Team collaboration and knowledge sharing |
| Your Agents | AI agents executing your workflows |

### Seven Levels of Agentic Prompts

| Level | Name | Key Feature |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | High Level Prompt | Simple static prompt |
| 2 | Workflow Prompt | Sequential task list |
| 3 | Control Flow | Conditional branching |
| 4 | Delegation Prompt | Multi-agent orchestration |
| 5 | Higher Order Prompts | Prompts within prompts |
| 6 | Template Meta Prompt | Prompt generation |
| 7 | Self-Improving Prompt | Self-modifying systems |

### The 80/20 Principle

- Levels 3-4 handle 80% of practical use cases
- Don't over-engineer - start simple
- Add complexity only when demonstrably needed
- Focus on workflow sections first

### Pattern Recognition Rule

**Three times marks a pattern** - When you repeat work three times:

1. Stop and recognize the pattern
2. Write it as a high-level prompt (Level 1)
3. Evolve up the levels as needed

### Best Practices

- Build libraries of reusable, battle-tested prompts
- Use composable sections like lego blocks
- Communicate to the trifecta (you, team, agents)
- Focus on ZTE (Zero-Touch Engineering) as your north star
- Start at Level 1 and evolve organically
