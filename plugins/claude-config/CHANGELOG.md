# Changelog

All notable changes to the `claude-config` plugin are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this plugin uses semantic versioning.

## [0.8.1]

### Changed

- Skills with `!` dynamic-context injections now declare `shell: bash` explicitly, per
  the pinned precompute convention — bash-only pipelines must not fall through to a
  PowerShell host.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- **`audit-model-fit` skill** (`/claude-config:audit-model-fit`). A fourth audit that sweeps the local
  Claude Code instruction surfaces — user + project `CLAUDE.md`, skill `SKILL.md` bodies + context
  files, agent definitions, `.claude/rules/**`, prompt-type hooks and output styles — for deterministic
  constraints that hobble newer, more capable models, and proposes removals/rewrites. Check catalog:
  bare prohibitions with no rationale (rewrite to add the *why*, never blanket-delete), over-prescriptive
  step lists (cull to intent + hard constraints), over-constraining example blocks (trim toward the
  recommended 3–5, not a blanket ban), and stale model-era workarounds — each measured against "would
  removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?". A bundled `instruction-surface-scan.sh` enumerates the
  surfaces and flags the two grep-able smells as candidates; the judgment stays in the skill body.
  **Report-only and human-gated**: it presents findings plus proposed diffs and never edits any
  instruction file itself (no `--fix`). Findings inside `melodic-software/standards`-managed
  materializations route upstream per the sync-manifest rather than being edited in place. Composes with
  (distinct intents, pointers only) `claude-memory:audit` (instruction-layer *health*, same surfaces),
  `skill-quality:check` (structure), `docs-hygiene:compress` (token brevity), and the sibling `audit`
  (config-file correctness). The plugin `description` now reads "Four audit skills".

## [0.7.1]

### Changed

- Documentation-only: the License section now states the plugin's own MIT
  license inline and no longer points at a `LICENSE` file at the repository
  root, which an installed consumer running from the isolated plugin cache
  cannot reach. No behavior change.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed

- **BREAKING — two skills renamed to the `audit-*` naming grammar** (fleet conformance wave, naming
  grammar): `automation-gaps` → `audit-automation-gaps` (`/claude-config:automation-gaps` →
  `/claude-config:audit-automation-gaps`) and `permission-hygiene` → `audit-permission-grants`
  (`/claude-config:permission-hygiene` → `/claude-config:audit-permission-grants`). The old
  invocations stop resolving; update any saved references. The `audit` skill is unchanged.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- **`setup` skill on the uniform contract** (`/claude-config:setup`). Closes the doctrine-tracked
  setup gap: the plugin's audit scripts require external CLIs (`jq` for all three skills, `curl` for
  the plugin-drift check) but no setup shipped. `check` (default, read-only) probes `jq`/`curl`/the
  bash shell against the bundled scripts as source of truth and reports PASS/FAIL/INFO — `jq` missing
  is a plugin-wide FAIL, `curl` missing a scoped FAIL for the drift check only. `apply` gives platform
  install guidance and re-verifies; it installs no system package and writes nothing. README
  Requirements now names the bash/Git-Bash shell prerequisite alongside `jq`/`curl`.

## [0.5.0]

### Changed

- Renamed the plugin `claude-config-audit` → `claude-config`. Reinstall as
  `claude-config@melodic-software` and update any `/claude-config-audit:*` invocations to the
  `/claude-config:*` namespace.
- Renamed the `settings-audit` skill → `audit` (`/claude-config:audit`) and the
  `automation-deep-dive` skill → `automation-gaps` (`/claude-config:automation-gaps`).
  `permission-hygiene` keeps its name (now `/claude-config:permission-hygiene`).

### Removed

- Extracted the `memory-health` skill into the new standalone `claude-memory` plugin, where it ships as
  the `health` skill (`/claude-memory:health`). Install `claude-memory@melodic-software` for the
  instruction/memory-layer audit.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- "Pre-computed context" blocks in the `automation-deep-dive`, `memory-health`, and `settings-audit`
  skills: `!`-executed commands inject live repo facts (automation inventory; memory/rules/CLAUDE.md
  counts and the RD1/M2 script-backed check counts; installed Claude Code version) at skill load, so
  each audit starts from guaranteed-fresh evidence instead of relying on the model to remember to run
  the bundled scripts. Every command carries an `|| echo` fallback so skill load never hard-fails.
  No `allowed-tools` self-grant ships with the blocks: a `Bash(bash <path>*)` grant is the
  interpreter-led P1 shape this plugin's own `permission-hygiene` criteria flag (auto mode drops it),
  and `!`-execution does not route through `allowed-tools`.
