# API Tools WSL

WSL runs Linux (Ubuntu), so API tool installation is identical to native Linux.

**Follow the Linux setup guide:** [API Tools Linux](api-tools-linux.md)

## WSL-Specific Notes

- API testing tools like Postman, Insomnia, and Bruno can be installed on Windows host or inside WSL
- For better integration with Windows browsers, install GUI tools on Windows host
- Command-line tools (curl, httpie, etc.) should be installed inside WSL for Linux development workflows
