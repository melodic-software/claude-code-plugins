# Figma Setup Linux

Figma is a collaborative design and prototyping tool used for UI/UX design, wireframing, and design handoff between designers and developers.

## Web Application (Recommended)

Figma works best on Linux through the browser-based web application:

[https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/)

The web app provides full functionality and is the officially supported method on Linux.

## Community Desktop Packages (Alternative)

Unofficial community-maintained desktop packages are available:

### Snap

```bash
sudo snap install figma-linux
```

### AppImage

Download from community repositories:

**Note:** These are unofficial community packages and may have limitations compared to the official web app.
