# Changelog

All notable changes to the `context-guard` plugin.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- `scripts/statusline-shim.sh` — the durable statusline wiring target. The operator wires the shim
  once; it resolves the newest installed `statusline-tee.sh` at run time (newest by mtime across
  marketplaces, skipping transient `temp_*` cache clones), so plugin version bumps never require
  re-wiring. Transparent in every path: no tee installed degrades to running the wrapped statusline
  alone, and a wired-standalone shim prints one diagnostic line instead of leaving a blank bar.
  Pure Bash builtins — no subprocess on the statusline path. Black-box test harness with 25
  assertions, including the two-shim chaining case.
- `skills/setup` `apply` now installs the shim (byte-identical copy to
  `~/.claude/context-guard/bin/statusline-shim.sh`, idempotent, inert until the operator wires it)
  alongside the existing zones.json seed/repair.

### Changed

- **Wiring is now the shim, not the tee** (breaking for the printed wiring only; existing wiring
  keeps working until the next update). `setup check` prints
  `bash ~/.claude/context-guard/bin/statusline-shim.sh …`, gained an installed-shim state check,
  and reclassifies a statusline wired to a version-pinned plugin-cache path as LEGACY wiring
  regardless of whether that file currently exists — the old state only flagged a path mismatch.
  Rationale: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is version-pinned and the old version directory is pruned
  ~14 days after an update, so cache-path wiring stops teeing at the next bump and then breaks the
  operator's whole statusline (`bash <missing>` → 127).
- `setup check` prints the sibling-composition wiring when `rate-limit-guard` is also installed,
  and states the measured per-tee refresh cost (~0.6–0.9 s on Windows/Git Bash, spawn-bound).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- `scripts/statusline-tee.sh` — transparent statusline wrapper teeing `captured_at` +
  `session_id` + the verbatim `context_window` object to the per-session snapshot path
  `~/.claude/context-guard/context/<session_id>.json` (atomic temp+rename, Windows rename retry,
  jq-missing visible degrade, session-id sanitization, 14-day sibling pruning, standalone mode).
- `scripts/context-zone.sh` — fail-open zone resolver printing `smart` / `acceptable` / `dumb` /
  `unknown`; shipped default bands 50/75 with `~/.claude/context-guard/zones.json` as the
  machine-scope override; malformed zones fall back visibly.
- `reference/reader-contract.md` — consumer contract: snapshot path pattern, file shape,
  10-minute staleness rule, fail-open capability table, zones.json shape, `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`
  discovery + fallback, inline-floor byte-identity rule, zone-is-not-a-compaction-indicator rule.
- `skills/setup` — `check` (read-only: jq, wiring with stale-cache-path detection, live-session
  snapshot freshness, zones state, printed operator edit) and `apply` (seeds/refreshes zones.json
  only), with evals.
- Black-box test harnesses for both scripts (sandboxed `HOME`, 80 assertions total).
