# Changelog

All notable changes to the `source-control` plugin are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this plugin uses semantic versioning.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- **`/source-control:babysit-prs` capability convergence.** The skill gains opt-in `worker` and
  `autopilot` tiers on top of the safe default: `worker` auto-resolves outdated bot threads and
  merges PRs the deterministic gate proves ready; `autopilot` widens author and thread scope
  under the watched owners. Both merge only behind `babysit_merge.py`'s gate — `mergeStateStatus
  == CLEAN` cross-checked, head-SHA pinned, never `--admin`, never force-push.
- **Decomposed Python engine** under `skills/babysit-prs/scripts/` (stdlib-only): `babysit_util`,
  `babysit_gh` (one parameterized discovery function, one reviewThreads paginator), `babysit_state`
  (scope-aware, schema-versioned, corrupt-state quarantine), `babysit_lease` (`--repo` scoping +
  snapshot pairing), `babysit_checks`, `babysit_feedback`, `babysit_review_trigger` (bot-agnostic,
  config-driven, dormant when unconfigured), `babysit_delta` (classification + fan-out + L3
  foreign-activity detection). Thin CLIs: `pr_queue_snapshot`, `babysit_merge`,
  `babysit_resolve_thread`, `manage_babysit_lease`, `manage_feedback_ledger`,
  `prune_babysit_worktrees`, `refresh_pr_branch`, `request_review`. Relocated + reorganized test
  suite runs in the plugin-tests lane (`engine.test.sh`, self-SKIP when Python is absent). Python
  3.11+ is a declared prerequisite for the `worker`/`autopilot` tiers only; the safe default runs
  Python-free.
- **First-in-fleet plugin `bin/` wrappers** — `source-control-babysit-merge` and
  `source-control-babysit-resolve-thread` expose the guarded mutations as bare commands whose
  allow rules survive auto mode; the merge wrapper refuses `--allow-unpinned-head`.
- **15 `userConfig` keys** (watched owners, self logins, default tier, merge method, the
  bot-agnostic review-trigger settings, bot-login fallbacks, downgrade-reviewer logins, cadence
  and fan-out bounds, worktree root) plus a babysit check/apply section in `/source-control:setup`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the safe default narrows discovery from every open PR to your own PRs under the
  current repository's owner (own-authorship boundary; Dependabot/dependency PRs are held from
  merge in every tier). `worker`/`autopilot` widen scope explicitly.
- State root moves from `CODEX_HOME` to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`; all engine configuration is now
  delivered via CLI flags substituted from the SKILL.md effective-config block.

### Removed

- The `BABYSIT_*` environment-variable seams on the Python engine (owners, timeouts, quiet-recheck
  window) — replaced by CLI flags fed from `userConfig`. The `/source-control:pull-request` seam
  gate's `--self` / `BABYSIT_SELF_LOGINS` contract is unchanged.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- **New `/source-control:babysit-prs` skill** — the all-PR self-pacing babysit loop, extracted
  from `/source-control:pull-request` into its own skill (distinct discovery intent: fleet loop
  vs single-PR lifecycle). Same behavior as the former `babysit` action: discovers every open
  non-draft PR oldest-first, checks each out, keeps branches fresh, classifies every review
  finding with GitHub-verified evidence, fixes valid findings, reports readiness. Never merges.
  Invoke via `/source-control:babysit-prs` (loop pairing: `/loop /source-control:babysit-prs`).
- **Plugin-scope shared review discipline** at `reference/review-discipline.md` — the canonical
  home of finding extraction (with the mandatory ≥3-finding subagent dispatch), per-finding
  D1–D7 verification gates, and self-reply filtering, cited by both `pull-request` and
  `babysit-prs` instead of duplicating the rules per skill.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the `babysit` action is removed from `/source-control:pull-request` — use
  `/source-control:babysit-prs`. The pull-request description, action table, phase table, and
  checklists no longer carry babysit content; `reference/monitor.md`'s cross-references into the
  former babysit reference now cite the plugin-scope review discipline.
- Shared scripts hoisted from `skills/pull-request/scripts/` to plugin-root `scripts/`
  (`fetch-all-pr-comments.sh`, `babysit-readiness-gate.sh`, `test-helpers.sh`, with their
  tests) — cited by both skills via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/`.

### Removed

- `discover-prs.sh` (+ test) — retired; the inline `gh pr list` filter in the babysit-prs
  reference is the discovery contract.

## [0.5.2]

### Fixed

- `/pull-request create`'s worktreeinclude sync check no longer reports phantom `CHANGED:` lines
  for `.worktreeinclude` patterns that match no files — an unmatched glob stays a literal string
  in Bash and previously fell through to the changed-file branch; it is now skipped.

## [0.5.1]

### Changed

- References to the renamed `/toolchain:build` skill now invoke `/toolchain:check` (toolchain 0.2.0 breaking rename). Version bumped so existing installs pick up the rewritten prompts.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **Exec-bit check in `/source-control:commit`.** Immediately after staging, newly-added files whose
  first line is a shebang (`#!`) are checked against the index and fixed with
  `git update-index --chmod=+x` when staged non-executable. Closes the gap where a new `.sh`/`.py`
  script lands as mode `100644` and is only caught by a CI exec-bit lint lane after the push
  round-trip. Runs after the format-before-push check below (not before), because re-staging a
  formatter's fixes reads the worktree file mode and would otherwise silently undo an
  already-applied `--chmod=+x`.
- **Format-before-push check in `/source-control:commit`.** Before drafting the commit message, the
  skill now checks the consuming repo for an already-configured formatter/linter (`package.json`
  scripts, `biome.json`, a `Makefile` target, `.editorconfig` + `editorconfig-checker`, or an
  equivalent repo-native tool) and runs it against the files staged for that commit, re-staging any
  fixes. Scoped to this commit's paths, not the full index, so it never mutates or blocks on staged
  work outside this commit's scope. Runs only tooling that already exists in the consuming repo;
  skips silently when none is discoverable.

## [0.4.1]

### Fixed

- Require a branch-derived issue to be open before adding `Closes #N`, preserve
  merge-commit branch history when integrating the default branch during PR
  babysitting, and stash a dirty worktree before reusing it for the next task.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- `/source-control:setup` skill: interviews the repo and writes the tracked
  `.claude/source-control.md` commit-subject / PR-title convention config —
  inferring first from the repo's own `CLAUDE.md`/rules, commit-msg hook, or
  git log history before asking. Offers Conventional Commits (11-type
  vocabulary) as the recommended default, or a custom pattern for orgs that
  don't use Conventional Commits. Re-runnable to reconfigure. Ships evals.

## [0.3.1]

### Changed

- Synced the pull-request verify-gate example to the reorganized taxonomy:
  `/verify-changes` / `/build` are now `/verification:confirm` / `/toolchain:build`.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- `/resolve-conflicts` skill: intent-first resolution of in-progress merge/rebase/cherry-pick
  conflicts — both sides' history read before any hunk is edited, compose-by-default with
  evidence-gated side-dropping, a post-resolution semantic-conflict sweep (build/tests before
  done), and a hard never-`--abort` discipline. Ships three evals.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Readiness security-gate, mixed-actor, and three worktree evals.
