# GitHub: pull-request ready for review

The GitHub commands behind the pull-request skill's
[ready-for-review phase](../../../../skills/pull-request/reference/ready-for-review.md). The phase
owns the order, the gates and the completion criteria; this file holds the commands and the GitHub
and `gh` facts behind them.

## Find the PR for the branch

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view "$BRANCH" --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null)
```

## Read the draft flag

```bash
gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json isDraft -q '.isDraft'
```

## Check for a hold

```bash
bash "<skill-dir>/scripts/check-ready-holds.sh" "$PR_NUMBER"               # a person drives the run
bash "<skill-dir>/scripts/check-ready-holds.sh" "$PR_NUMBER" --unattended  # no person drives it
```

Exit 0: no hold. Exit 3: held or superseded, one reason per line on stdout. Exit 2: a `gh` read
or a parse failed, so no hold was ruled out. Exit 1: a bad argument. Exit 5: `gh` or `jq` is
missing. The script reads the title, body, labels and closing issue
references with `gh pr view`, and each closing issue's state over REST.

## Read the pre-ready steps at the base

The base branch's copy, from the base repository. A 404, or any failed read, leaves the document
empty, so every step runs.

```bash
BASE=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json baseRefName -q '.baseRefName')
PRE_READY_DOC=$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/docs/conventions/source-control.yaml?ref=$BASE" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" 2>/dev/null) || PRE_READY_DOC=""
printf '%s' "$PRE_READY_DOC" | bash "<skill-dir>/scripts/read-pre-ready.sh" -
```

## Refresh the base with a merge

```bash
BASE=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json baseRefName -q '.baseRefName')
REMOTE=$(bash "<skill-dir>/scripts/resolve-remote.sh") || exit 1

gh pr update-branch "$PR_NUMBER"                     # merges the base into the head branch
git fetch "$REMOTE" "$BRANCH" && git merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD
```

When the head already contains the base tip, `gh pr update-branch` prints "PR branch already
up-to-date" and pushes nothing (cli/cli `pkg/cmd/pr/update-branch/update_branch.go`, the
`BehindBy == 0` return, read 2026-10-02; recheck when a gh release changes `update-branch`).

The PR's head commit, for the completion check:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefOid -q '.headRefOid'
```

## Read the diff

```bash
gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER"
```

## Flip to ready

```bash
gh pr ready "$PR_NUMBER"
```

In a cloud session `gh pr ready` fails, because the flip is a GraphQL mutation. The proxy's REST
route:

```bash
gh api --method POST "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/ccr/ready_for_review"
```

Or the GitHub MCP `update_pull_request` call with `draft: false`.
