# Telemetry comment upsert (singleton, race-converging)

The exact upsert this lane runs at cycle-shape step 6 to maintain its ONE sentinel-identified status
comment. `SKILL.md`'s "Telemetry and durable loop state" owns where the comment lives and what goes
in it; this file owns how the singleton is maintained and how a creation race converges.

The upsert is inlined in this plugin rather than invoked from `claude-ops` because an installed
plugin cannot invoke a sibling plugin's scripts.

```bash
MARKER="source-control:babysit-loop"
SENT="<!-- claude-ops:lane-telemetry marker=$MARKER -->"   # first line of $BODY_FILE
LOOKUP() { gh api --paginate "repos/$REPO/issues/$ISSUE/comments" \
  --jq ".[] | select(.body | startswith(\"$SENT\")) | .id"; }
if ! LIST=$(LOOKUP); then
  echo "telemetry: comment lookup failed; skipping upsert this cycle (fail closed)" >&2
else
  if [ -z "$LIST" ]; then
    gh api -X POST "repos/$REPO/issues/$ISSUE/comments" -F body=@"$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
    LIST=$(LOOKUP) || LIST=""   # re-list; a failure here converges next cycle
  fi
  CANON=$(printf '%s\n' "$LIST" | sort -n | head -n1)
  if [ -n "$CANON" ]; then
    gh api -X PATCH "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$CANON" -F body=@"$BODY_FILE"
    for DUP in $(printf '%s\n' "$LIST" | sort -n | tail -n +2); do
      gh api -X PATCH "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$DUP" \
        -f body="Superseded duplicate - canonical telemetry comment: $CANON" || true
    done
  fi
fi
```

**Creation race reconcile (encoded above).** Two sessions racing the first-ever upsert can both
see an empty lookup and both POST, forking the singleton. The upsert converges every cycle
duplicates are visible: the LOWEST comment id is canonical (numeric sort, deterministic for
every session), the canonical comment receives the current cycle's full state, and every other
sentinel comment is edited to a one-line tombstone so it never matches a lookup again — this
covers a racer that died between its POST and its own re-list, because the NEXT session's
ordinary upsert performs the same reconcile. A crashed racer's unmerged counters are an
accepted loss (durable state re-derives over a cycle); nothing is deleted.
