# Implement Plan

Execute the following plan. This is a Higher-Order Prompt - it accepts a plan (another prompt) as input and implements it.

## Instructions

- Read the plan file completely before starting
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the implementation approach
- Follow the Step by Step Tasks in order
- Check off tasks as you complete them mentally
- Run Validation Commands after implementation to verify success
- Report your work using git diff --stat

## Implementation Protocol

1. **Read**: Load and understand the entire plan
2. **Reason**: Think through the implementation approach
3. **Execute**: Complete each task in order
4. **Validate**: Run all validation commands
5. **Report**: Summarize what was done

## Plan

$ARGUMENTS

## Report

After implementing the plan:

1. Summarize the work you've done in a concise bullet point list
2. Report files and total lines changed with `git diff --stat`
3. Note any deviations from the plan and why
4. List any issues encountered and how they were resolved
