## Key Concepts from This Lesson

### Closed Loop Prompts

Prompts that include validation and self-correction mechanisms, allowing agents to execute, validate, and correct their work in a continuous cycle.

### Feedback Loop Types

- **Linter**: Static code analysis
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function/method testing
- **UI Tests**: User interface validation
- **CI/CD Integration Tests**: Continuous integration checks
- **Build/Compile**: Application compilation verification
- **Log Monitoring**: Datadog, Sentry error tracking
- **LLM as Judge**: AI-based evaluation workflows

### Agentic Coding KPIs

- **Attempts**: Number of tries to complete a task (want DOWN)
- **Size**: Scope of work completed per session (want UP)
- **Streak**: Consecutive successful completions (want UP)
- **Presence**: Human intervention required (want DOWN)
