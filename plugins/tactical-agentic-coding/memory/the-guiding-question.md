# The Guiding Question

## The Question

> "Am I working on the agentic layer or am I working on the application layer?"

This single question compresses all eight tactics, all KPIs, and all leverage points into one daily decision framework.

## Why It Matters

Even if you forget all eight tactics, this question tells you if you're moving in the right direction.

## All 8 Tactics Summarized

| # | Tactic | Core Idea |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | **Stop Coding** | Agents write code now |
| 2 | **Adopt Agent's Perspective** | 12 leverage points |
| 3 | **Template Your Engineering** | Meta-prompts and plans |
| 4 | **Stay Out The Loop** | PITER framework, AFK agents |
| 5 | **Always Add Feedback Loops** | Tests, validation, self-correction |
| 6 | **One Agent, One Purpose** | Specialized focused agents |
| 7 | **Target Zero-Touch Engineering** | Drop presence to 1, auto-ship |
| 8 | **Prioritize Agentics** | 50%+ time on agentic layer |

The guiding question is Tactic #8 - the meta-tactic that contains all others.

## Daily Application

### Morning Check

Ask yourself: "What am I working on today?"

**If Application Layer:**

- Writing application code directly
- Configuring infrastructure
- Managing databases
- Fixing one-off bugs manually

**If Agentic Layer:**

- Creating/improving slash commands
- Building workflow templates
- Adding feedback loops (tests)
- Improving agent context (CLAUDE.md)
- Creating composed workflows

### Target Distribution

| Activity | Time |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Agentic Layer work | 50%+ |
| Application Layer work | <50% |

## Agentic Layer Activities

Working ON the agents, not WITH the agents:

- Creating new slash commands
- Improving existing templates
- Building ADW scripts
- Adding hooks and triggers
- Improving test coverage
- Enhancing agent context
- Creating composed workflows
- Building observability
- Setting up worktree isolation
- Designing new primitives

## Application Layer Activities

The traditional work agents will eventually do:

- Writing application code
- DevOps configuration
- Database management
- Infrastructure setup
- Manual bug fixes
- Direct code changes
- Configuration management
- Deployment scripts

## The Shift

**Before agentic coding:**

- 100% application layer
- You write all the code
- Manual everything

**During transition:**

- 50% agentic, 50% application
- Building systems that build systems
- Teaching agents your patterns

**After mastery:**

- 80%+ agentic layer
- Agents handle problem classes
- You architect and review

## Decision Framework

When faced with any task, ask:

1. **Is this a one-off?** -> Consider if it's actually a problem class
2. **Will I do this again?** -> Build a template instead
3. **Can an agent do this?** -> Invest in agentic layer first
4. **Am I writing code myself?** -> Should I be teaching agents instead?

## Key Insight

> "On a day-to-day tactical level, even if you forget all eight tactics, this is all you need to think about. Am I working on the agentic layer or am I working on the application layer?"

The irreplaceable engineer of the future operates primarily on the agentic layer.
