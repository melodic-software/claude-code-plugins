# TAC Philosophy: Become the Engineer They Can't Replace

Core philosophy from Tactical Agentic Coding (TAC) Lesson 001 by @IndyDevDan.

## Mission

**Become the engineer they can't replace.**

"They" are your boss, your company, your industry, AI itself. In the tech world, nothing is forever. You must constantly evolve.

## Tactic #1: Stop Coding

**Your hands and mind are no longer the best tools for writing code.**

Powerful language models wrapped in agentic architectures running on supercomputers are now vastly superior coders. Use the best tool for the job.

This is uncomfortable but essential:

- Throughout TAC, we don't type a single line of code
- If you're still typing code, you have no chance of keeping up
- Don't be the engineer that can't let go of the past

**What this doesn't mean:**

- You still generate code (code produces features, products)
- Code understanding remains critically important
- You're an engineer, not a coder - the difference is massive

**Where engineering cycles go instead:**

- Planning
- Reviewing
- Creating closed loop structures

## Phase 1 vs Phase 2

### Phase 1: AI Coding

- You generate code using the Big Three: **Context, Model, Prompt**
- Focus: Writing code faster
- Primary tool: Aider and similar AI coding assistants
- Outcome: Commoditized code (anyone can build an app with one prompt)

### Phase 2: Agentic Coding

- You command compute to build systems of leverage
- Focus: Building systems that build systems
- Primary tool: Claude Code
- Outcome: Self-operating machines (codebases that run themselves)

## Commander of Compute

In every software revolution, we move up the stack. Now: **Become a commander of compute.**

You don't just prompt to generate code (that's Phase 1). You take this compute and use it to build systems that build systems.

**The irreplaceable engineer:**

- Transforms codebases into self-operating machines
- Maximizes leverage so the codebase literally runs itself
- Invests time in the right places
- Repeatedly extracts value using the right compute at the right time

## The Paradox of TAC

To become an irreplaceable engineer, you will replace yourself.

You won't see vibe coders replicating what you'll be able to do when you finish TAC.

## Engineering Was Never About Writing Code

Engineering is about building **systems of leverage** that produce valuable outcomes for users and customers.

The 10X engineer opportunity isn't about 10X time or effort - it's about finding and exploiting **leverage points**.

80% of life is noise, space, boring repetition, and wasted time. But every once in a while, an opportunity presents itself that can change everything. TAC is that opportunity.
