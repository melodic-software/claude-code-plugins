[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this plugin uses semantic versioning.

## [0.4.1]

### Changed

- Synced work-item filing routes to the reorganized `work-items` taxonomy:
  `/work-items:work-items add` is now `/work-items:track add` (README, `tidy`,
  `batch-simplify`, and the scope-budget reference).

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Stdlib-only frontmatter-fence integrity check in the self-update lane's verification commands: a portable python one-liner that confirms every SKILL.md's `---` fences are present and the frontmatter between them is non-empty, since a broken fence would block the next session's skill discovery.
