# Changelog

All notable changes to the `review-toolkit` plugin are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this plugin uses semantic versioning.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- **Skill evals for the two orchestration skills.** Rich-form `evals/evals.json` authored for
  `quality-gate` (6 cases) and `code-review-fanout` (6 cases), each covering trigger/routing, the
  happy path, a refusal/guardrail, and an anti-pattern the skill must not do. Additive test
  definitions only — no behavioral change to any skill or agent.

## [0.2.0]

### Changed

- **`ecosystem-specialist` consumes the ecosystem-commands contract.** The agent now resolves each
  ecosystem's build/test/lint command truth from the consumer repo's `.claude/ecosystems/<ecosystem>.yaml`
  files (authoritative when present) — the marketplace-wide ecosystem-commands contract
  (`docs/conventions/ecosystem-commands/README.md`) — falling back to the project's documented
  conventions, then the agent's own bundled generic defaults as an explicit last resort. Ecosystem
  detection may use the contract's `globs` when config exists. Report format, MISSING-tool handling,
  and detection behavior are unchanged; only the command-truth sourcing moved from the agent's inline
  defaults to the declared contract.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: six read-only reviewer agents (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`,
  `architecture-guardian`, `doc-drift-detector`, `ecosystem-specialist`, `ci-log-auditor`) plus two
  orchestration skills (`quality-gate`, `code-review-fanout`).
