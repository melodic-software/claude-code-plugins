The Files API allows you to upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without having to re-upload content with each request. For more information about the Files API, see the [developer guide for files](/en/docs/build-with-claude/files).

<Note>
  The Files API is currently in beta. To use the Files API, you'll need to include the beta feature header: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`.
