Today we’re announcing that we’re expanding our global operations to India, with plans to open an office in Bengaluru in early 2026. Bengaluru will serve as our second office in Asia Pacific after [Tokyo](https://www.anthropic.com/news/head-of-japan-hiring-plans), which will open in the coming months. This expansion will help us serve India’s rapidly growing AI ecosystem and reflects the increasing international demand we’re seeing for Claude.

Our CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei is visiting India this week to meet with public officials and enterprise partners as we deepen our commitment to the region.

“India is compelling because of the scale of its technical talent and the commitment from the Indian government to ensure the benefits of artificial intelligence reach all areas of society, not just concentrated pockets,” said Dario. “There is deep alignment between the challenges India is tackling and our mission as a company, from deploying AI across diverse languages and contexts, to building frameworks for responsible governance. India's AI ecosystem will play a central role in how AI develops globally and democratically, and we’re looking forward to working with organizations in India to pave a path for how beneficial AI can be scaled in a way that serves everyone.”

Our focus in India will be deploying AI for social impact in sectors like education, healthcare, and agriculture, as well as supporting key industries through strategic partnerships with Indian enterprises, nonprofits, and startups. The Bengaluru office will support India’s entrepreneurial ecosystem as it develops the next generation of dynamic companies.

According to our recent [Economic Index Report](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index), India ranks second globally in consumer usage of Claude, behind only the US. And a disproportionately large amount of Claude usage in India is for technical and programming-related tasks, such as mobile UI development and web app debugging. Large Indian enterprises like [CRED](https://claude.com/customers/cred) rely on Claude for their most critical coding work. And considering the rapid global adoption of Claude Code—with usage growing over 10x in just the first three months after its May launch—we believe Claude has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth among India's export-focused IT services industry.

“Our expansion comes at a pivotal moment when Indian enterprises and startups are seeking AI models they can trust,” said Paul Smith, Anthropic’s Chief Commercial Officer. “They need systems that combine frontier performance with the safety and reliability required to support critical business operations at the massive scale that they operate. We see remarkable promise in India’s innovation ecosystem – the vibrant startup and developer communities alongside Indian enterprises are building solutions that impact millions of lives globally.”

Our expansion into India also dovetails with our continuing investment in advancing Claude’s Indic language capabilities. Building robust support for the languages and contexts that matter most to users in India will be a cornerstone of our work in the region. Claude already provides support across major Indic languages, and will launch enhanced performance in Hindi and nearly a dozen additional languages, including Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Punjabi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, and Urdu. These extended capabilities will strengthen public sector adoption and enable broader access to AI across all of India.
