# Paul Smith to join Anthropic as Chief Commercial Officer

Jul 15, 2025

Anthropic will appoint Paul Smith as its first Chief Commercial Officer, who will assume the role later this year. Paul will bring over 30 years of experience building and scaling global go-to-market organizations at some of the world's most successful enterprise technology companies, including Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.

Confirmation of Paul's appointment comes at a moment of exceptional growth for Anthropic, particularly in the enterprise market. We now serve hundreds of thousands of active API customers, while Claude Code has seen its recurring revenue grow over 5x in just two months. From the fastest growing startups to the Fortune 500, businesses across every industry are deploying Claude to transform their operations.

“Anthropic has taken a deliberate approach from the beginning—focusing our efforts on AI systems that businesses can trust and deploy at scale,” said Daniela Amodei, President of Anthropic. “Paul's experience building go-to-market powerhouses at Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow will strengthen our commercial organization and help more businesses worldwide become AI-native when he starts later this year.”

"Anthropic's growth is unprecedented, and yet most enterprises are still in the early stages of AI adoption. The potential ahead is massive,” said Paul. “Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to build teams that have guided companies through transformative technology shifts. And I could not be more excited by the opportunity to help customers navigate AI—the biggest shift of all—with Anthropic.”

AI is fundamentally restructuring how businesses create and capture value. Paul's expertise will help us support more organizations in navigating this transition thoughtfully, as we work to become the most trusted AI partner for businesses.
