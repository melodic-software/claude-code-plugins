# Changelog

All notable changes to the `typos-format` plugin are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this plugin uses semantic versioning.

## [0.3.5]

### Fixed

- **Shared `hook-utils.sh`: a large tool payload no longer makes this plugin's hooks silently
  skip (#1563).** `hook::buffer_stdin` read the hook payload with `read -d ''`, which consumes a
  pipe one byte at a time (~32 KB/s on Git Bash), so the `stdin_read_timeout` bound was really a
  ~64 KB throughput ceiling rather than the stall detector it was written to be. Past that ceiling
  the read returned a truncated payload and rc 1, and this plugin's hooks took their `|| exit 0`
  branch — the hook did not run at all, with no diagnostic, on exactly the large writes it was
  most wanted for. The read is now chunked (`read -N`), which bash satisfies with block reads, and
  the bound became an idle bound that arms per chunk: a read still making progress is never cut
  off, while a pipe that goes silent for `stdin_read_timeout` seconds still stops the read the
  same way. Measured: 50 KB drops from ~2100 ms to ~20 ms, 200 KB from ~6800 ms to ~85 ms. Synced
  from `lib/hook-utils.sh`; this plugin's own hook behavior is otherwise unchanged.

## [0.3.4]

### Changed

- **Test scaffolding: migrated `mktemp -p` temp file/dir creation to the portable `mktemp "$DIR/template"` form.** BSD/macOS `mktemp` has no `-p` flag; the directory now rides in the positional TEMPLATE argument instead, which both GNU and BSD `mktemp` accept identically. Test-only — no hook behavior change. Part of #1527 (`typos-format.test.sh`).

## [0.3.3]

### Fixed

- **Shared `hook-utils.sh`: a bare or trailing unquoted `NAME=value` Bash
  command no longer leaks the assignment value into the privacy-safe
  telemetry/audit subject.** `hook::extract_bash_subject` stripped a leading
  `VAR=value` prefix only when a following command word consumed it, so a
  command whose LAST token was an unquoted assignment (e.g. `TOKEN=ghp_…`)
  survived to the subject and emitted `Bash:TOKEN=ghp_…` into
  `hook-events.jsonl` and any wired `HOOK_TELEMETRY_SINK`. A resolved token
  still shaped like a shell assignment now bails to the bare `Bash` subject,
  matching the existing quoted-value bail (`VAR=x cmd` still reduces to
  `Bash:cmd`). Synced from `lib/hook-utils.sh`; the subject is
  telemetry/audit-only, so no guard or formatter block/allow behavior changes.

## [0.3.2]

### Fixed

- **Headless reconfigure recipe now preserves install scope (#1406).** The `claude plugin
  uninstall` → `claude plugin install ... --config` recipe in `skills/setup/SKILL.md` defaulted
  both halves to `-s user`. When this plugin is installed at `project` or `local` scope, that
  silently uninstalled a separate user-scope record while the effective project/local install kept
  loading, and the reinstall landed at a scope that does not load. Both commands now carry
  `-s <scope>`, sourced from what `claude plugin list` reports for this plugin — the same fix
  already applied to `session-flow` and `rate-limit-guard` in #1393.

## [0.3.1]

### Changed

- Sync of the shared `hook-utils.sh`: the git-option parser distinguishes `--config-env`
  (an env-var name) from `-c`/`--config` (an inline value), and a `--config-env` alias for
  a guarded subcommand is refused by shape rather than by resolving the environment
  variable's value (`#740`). No behavior change for this plugin — it does not inspect git
  config values; shipped so consumers receive the shared library update.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- **`statusMessage` declared on the hook's `hooks.json` handler** (hook-observability
  convention, `docs/conventions/hook-observability/`): a spinner label ("Fixing
  typos...") now shows while the hook runs. Config-only — no runtime behavior
  change.

## [0.2.0]

### Changed

- **Removed the opt-in config-gate.** The hook now runs `typos --write-changes`
  unconditionally on every `Write`/`Edit`, matching `markdown-format`'s existing
  unconditional pattern — typos ships a built-in spelling dictionary and needs
  no configuration to be useful. Previously the hook silently no-op'd on any
  repo without a hand-authored `typos.toml`/`_typos.toml`/`.typos.toml`/
  `Cargo.toml`/`pyproject.toml`, defeating the plugin's zero-config auto-fix
  purpose on exactly the repos it was meant to help. A consumer typos config,
  when present, is still discovered and honored automatically by typos itself
  (allowlist/exclude) — this hook never re-implemented that discovery and
  still doesn't; only the activation gate is removed.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release: a `PostToolUse` hook that runs `typos --write-changes` on
  `Write`/`Edit` of any file, gated on a consumer typos config
  (`typos.toml`/`_typos.toml`/`.typos.toml`/`Cargo.toml`/`pyproject.toml`)
  found by an ancestor walk-up, mirroring the `ruff-format`/`markdown-format`
  plugin pattern. Residual (unfixable) findings surface via `additionalContext`
  with remediation guidance pointing at `extend-words` / `extend-identifiers` /
  `extend-ignore-re` allowlist entries. Advisory only — never blocks the edit.
- `hook-telemetry` conformance: emits a schema-valid envelope
  (`docs/conventions/hook-telemetry/data/typos-format.schema.json`) via the
  shared `hook::emit_telemetry` helper.
- `/typos-format:setup check|apply` skill for prerequisite verification.
