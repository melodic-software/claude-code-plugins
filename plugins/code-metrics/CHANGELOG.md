## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **`audit-size`:** lines per file for a change, a path, or the whole tree, comment-aware through
  `scc` when it resolves and comment-agnostic from a bundled counter otherwise, reported beside a
  cited reference (1000 non-blank lines, the plugin's own number) and never as a finding.
- **The dispatcher and report contract:** scope resolution (change, paths, `--all`), lane detection
  by extension with consumer glob overrides, a collector ladder shipped as data
  (`scripts/collector-ladder.tsv`), and the `code-metrics/v1` JSON document with its
  "Coverage of this run" table, `status` of `complete`, `partial`, or `empty`, and the exit-code
  taxonomy 0/2/3.
