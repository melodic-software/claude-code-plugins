## [0.3.0]

Fixes driven by a live Windows user-profile audit where the engine was unusable through its
sanctioned lane and the guard's protections did not cover the platform's primary shell.

### Added

- `--data-root` on scan, preview, and apply. The Bash guard validates the value against the
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` its own hook process received (the runtime exports it to hook processes but
  not to shell tool subprocesses, so the engine could previously never find its generated-state
  root through the guarded lane) and discloses the authorized value in denial guidance alongside
  the interpreter path. Absent hook authority the flag fails closed; the environment variable
  remains honored as a fallback.
- `--max-depth` bounded scans. Directories at the cutoff are recorded in `truncated_paths`,
  reported as coverage gaps, and blocked from plans by a new `truncated-not-inventoried` preview
  blocker. This makes a profile-root audit possible: the previous all-or-nothing walk exceeded the
  250k entry cap on any real home directory before reaching a single loose file.
- PowerShell guard lane (matcher now `Bash|PowerShell`): engine invocations from PowerShell are
  hard-denied (Bash stays the only engine lane), and known deletion spellings / .NET Delete calls
  surface a final human permission prompt instead of executing silently. Read-only support work
  passes through untouched.
- Documented unsupported-platform manual handoff: on Windows/macOS, after the same exact-list
  human approval as the engine lane, removal proceeds manually with per-path revalidation and
  reversible (Recycle Bin / Trash) deletion preferred.
- Scan progress heartbeat to stderr every 25k entries; the entry-cap error now suggests
  `--max-depth`.
- `os_autoclean` advisory is computed before the walk and included in scan failure payloads, so a
  capped profile scan still surfaces the Storage Sense / systemd-tmpfiles recommendation.
- Baseline hints for `tmp_*` (medium ceiling) and `scratch*` (low ceiling) artifacts.

### Changed

- Generated-state error messages name the `--data-root`/`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` pair instead of the
  environment variable alone.
