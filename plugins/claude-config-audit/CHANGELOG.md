## [0.4.0]

### Added

- "Pre-computed context" blocks in the `automation-deep-dive`, `memory-health`, and `settings-audit`
  skills: `!`-executed commands inject live repo facts (automation inventory; memory/rules/CLAUDE.md
  counts and the RD1/M2 script-backed check counts; installed Claude Code version) at skill load, so
  each audit starts from guaranteed-fresh evidence instead of relying on the model to remember to run
  the bundled scripts. Every command carries an `|| echo` fallback so skill load never hard-fails.
  No `allowed-tools` self-grant ships with the blocks: a `Bash(bash <path>*)` grant is the
  interpreter-led P1 shape this plugin's own `permission-hygiene` criteria flag (auto mode drops it),
  and `!`-execution does not route through `allowed-tools`.
