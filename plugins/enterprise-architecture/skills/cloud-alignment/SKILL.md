# Cloud Alignment

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Check alignment with Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
- Validate against AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars
- Identify cloud architecture gaps
- Get cloud-specific best practice recommendations

**Keywords:** cloud adoption framework, caf, well-architected, azure, aws, landing zone, governance, security pillar, reliability, cost optimization, sustainability

## Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

CAF provides comprehensive guidance for Azure cloud adoption through 7 methodologies:

### CAF Methodologies

| # | Methodology | Purpose | Key Activities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Strategy** | Define business justification | Motivations, outcomes, business case |
| 2 | **Plan** | Create adoption plan | Digital estate, skills, timeline |
| 3 | **Ready** | Prepare environment | Landing zones, governance baseline |
| 4 | **Adopt** | Migrate/innovate workloads | Migration waves, modernization |
| 5 | **Govern** | Manage cloud governance | Policies, compliance, cost management |
| 6 | **Secure** | Implement security | Zero trust, identity, data protection |
| 7 | **Manage** | Operate cloud estate | Monitoring, optimization, resilience |

### CAF Alignment Checklist

#### Strategy

- [ ] Cloud motivations documented
- [ ] Business outcomes defined
- [ ] Financial considerations addressed
- [ ] Technical considerations documented

#### Plan

- [ ] Digital estate assessed
- [ ] Skills readiness evaluated
- [ ] Cloud adoption plan created
- [ ] Azure readiness confirmed

#### Ready

- [ ] Landing zone deployed
- [ ] Governance baseline established
- [ ] Network topology defined
- [ ] Identity management configured

#### Adopt

- [ ] Workload assessment complete
- [ ] Migration/modernization approach selected
- [ ] Testing and validation plan
- [ ] Cutover plan documented

#### Govern

- [ ] Governance policies defined
- [ ] Cost management implemented
- [ ] Compliance requirements mapped
- [ ] Security baselines established

#### Secure

- [ ] Identity and access management
- [ ] Network security configured
- [ ] Data protection implemented
- [ ] Threat protection enabled

#### Manage

- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] Operations procedures documented
- [ ] Optimization practices established

### MCP Integration

For current CAF documentation, use the microsoft-learn MCP server:

```text
mcp__microsoft-learn__microsoft_docs_search: "cloud adoption framework [topic]"
mcp__microsoft-learn__microsoft_docs_fetch: [specific URL]
```

**MCP Server Requirement**: This skill uses `mcp__microsoft-learn__*` tools for fetching current Microsoft documentation. If the microsoft-learn MCP server is not configured:

1. **Check availability**: The skill's `allowed-tools` includes MCP tools - if unavailable, queries will fail
2. **Fallback approach**: Use `WebSearch` or `WebFetch` to access Microsoft Learn documentation directly at `https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/`
3. **Offline reference**: The `memory/cloud-frameworks/caf-pillars.md` file contains static CAF reference content

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

The Well-Architected Framework provides guidance through 6 pillars:

### Well-Architected Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Key Questions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Operational Excellence** | Run and monitor systems | How do you manage workload and events? |
| **Security** | Protect data and systems | How do you manage identities and permissions? |
| **Reliability** | Recover from failures | How do you manage service failures? |
| **Performance Efficiency** | Use resources efficiently | How do you select appropriate resources? |
| **Cost Optimization** | Avoid unnecessary costs | How do you manage usage and cost? |
| **Sustainability** | Minimize environmental impact | How do you reduce carbon footprint? |

### Well-Architected Alignment Checklist

#### Operational Excellence

- [ ] Operations as code implemented
- [ ] Documentation maintained
- [ ] Small, frequent changes practiced
- [ ] Failure procedures tested
- [ ] Lessons learned captured

#### Security

- [ ] Horizontal scaling enabled
- [ ] Capacity planning in place
- [ ] Change management automated

#### Performance Efficiency

- [ ] Right-sized resources
- [ ] Global reach where needed
- [ ] Serverless where appropriate
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Experimentation enabled

#### Cost Optimization

- [ ] Cloud financial management
