## [0.2.6]

### Fixed

- **Shared `hook-utils.sh`: an in-project file spelled as a Windows 8.3 short name is no longer
  silently skipped (#1636).** `hook::physical_path` canonicalized with GNU realpath, which under
  Git Bash resolves symlinks but leaves 8.3 short names (`KYLESE~1`) unexpanded, so a short-form
  `file_path` — the shape Claude Code's own scratchpad paths take — failed the
  `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` prefix comparison in `hook::read_file_path` and the hook skipped the file
  silently: no lint, no notice, no telemetry. The lib now expands short names on Windows/MSYS
  hosts (new `hook::expand_8dot3`, via `cygpath -l`) before the comparison, and only when the
  expanded form actually differs — a legitimate long name containing `~` passes through
  untouched, and a genuinely out-of-project file is still skipped: that defense-in-depth scoping
  is deliberate and preserved. 8.3 generation is a per-volume property (`fsutil 8dot3name
  query`), so the defect was live only for checkouts on a volume that generates short names —
  and invisible to contributors whose checkouts sit on one that does not. Synced from
  `lib/hook-utils.sh`.

## [0.2.5]

### Fixed

- **Shared `hook-utils.sh`: a large tool payload no longer makes this plugin's hooks silently
  skip (#1563).** `hook::buffer_stdin` read the hook payload with `read -d ''`, which consumes a
  pipe one byte at a time (~32 KB/s on Git Bash), so the `stdin_read_timeout` bound was really a
  ~64 KB throughput ceiling rather than the stall detector it was written to be. Past that ceiling
  the read returned a truncated payload and rc 1, and this plugin's hooks took their `|| exit 0`
  branch — the hook did not run at all, with no diagnostic, on exactly the large writes it was
  most wanted for. The read is now chunked (`read -N`), which bash satisfies with block reads, and
  the bound became a true idle bound: `read -t` is a deadline for the whole requested read rather
  than an inactivity timer, so a timed-out read that nevertheless returned bytes is now treated as
  progress — its partial chunk is kept and a fresh window is armed. Only a window that delivers
  nothing at all is a stall. `read -N` is Bash 4.1+, and these hooks support Bash 3.2+ (macOS
  system bash), so the pre-4.1 path falls back to the delimiter read inside the same re-arming
  loop. Measured: 50 KB drops from ~2100 ms to ~20 ms, 200 KB from ~6800 ms to ~85 ms. Synced
  from `lib/hook-utils.sh`; this plugin's own hook behavior is otherwise unchanged.

## [0.2.4]

### Changed

- **Test scaffolding: migrated `mktemp -p` temp file/dir creation to the portable `mktemp "$DIR/template"` form.** BSD/macOS `mktemp` has no `-p` flag; the directory now rides in the positional TEMPLATE argument instead, which both GNU and BSD `mktemp` accept identically. Test-only — no hook behavior change. Part of #1527 (`go-format.test.sh`).

## [0.2.3]

### Fixed

- **Shared `hook-utils.sh`: a bare or trailing unquoted `NAME=value` Bash
  command no longer leaks the assignment value into the privacy-safe
  telemetry/audit subject.** `hook::extract_bash_subject` stripped a leading
  `VAR=value` prefix only when a following command word consumed it, so a
  command whose LAST token was an unquoted assignment (e.g. `TOKEN=ghp_…`)
  survived to the subject and emitted `Bash:TOKEN=ghp_…` into
  `hook-events.jsonl` and any wired `HOOK_TELEMETRY_SINK`. A resolved token
  still shaped like a shell assignment now bails to the bare `Bash` subject,
  matching the existing quoted-value bail (`VAR=x cmd` still reduces to
  `Bash:cmd`). Synced from `lib/hook-utils.sh`; the subject is
  telemetry/audit-only, so no guard or formatter block/allow behavior changes.

## [0.2.2]

### Fixed

- **Headless reconfigure recipe now preserves install scope (#1406).** The `claude plugin
  uninstall` → `claude plugin install ... --config` recipe in `skills/setup/SKILL.md` defaulted
  both halves to `-s user`. When this plugin is installed at `project` or `local` scope, that
  silently uninstalled a separate user-scope record while the effective project/local install kept
  loading, and the reinstall landed at a scope that does not load. Both commands now carry
  `-s <scope>`, sourced from what `claude plugin list` reports for this plugin — the same fix
  already applied to `session-flow` and `rate-limit-guard` in #1393.

## [0.2.1]

### Changed

- Sync of the shared `hook-utils.sh`: the git-option parser distinguishes `--config-env`
  (an env-var name) from `-c`/`--config` (an inline value), and a `--config-env` alias for
  a guarded subcommand is refused by shape rather than by resolving the environment
  variable's value (`#740`). No behavior change for this plugin — it does not inspect git
  config values; shipped so consumers receive the shared library update.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **`statusMessage` declared on the hook's `hooks.json` handler** (hook-observability
  convention, `docs/conventions/hook-observability/`): a spinner label ("Formatting
  Go imports...") now shows while the hook runs. Config-only — no runtime behavior
  change.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- Documented the generated-file guard's known limitation in
  `hooks/go-format.sh`: the leading-block scan is a deliberate string-match
  approximation of Go's own `ast.IsGenerated` (a parsed-AST classifier), the
  gap between the two is structural rather than a fixable bug, and no further
  pattern patches are planned unless a real-world generated file is observed
  defeating the scan — at which point the structural fix is a `go`-toolchain
  shell-out, not another pattern. Documentation-only; no behavior change.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release: a `PostToolUse` hook that runs `goimports -w` on
  `Write`/`Edit` of a `.go` file — unconditionally, with no consumer-config
  opt-in gate (the one deliberate shape difference from the
  `ruff-format`/`typos-format` pattern; see issue #832's field survey).
  Skips files carrying Go's `// Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT.` marker.
  Syntax errors goimports can't parse surface via `additionalContext` as an
  advisory finding, never a tool break. Advisory only — never blocks the
  edit.
- `hook-telemetry` conformance: emits a schema-valid envelope
  (`docs/conventions/hook-telemetry/data/go-format.schema.json`) via the
  shared `hook::emit_telemetry` helper.
- `/go-format:setup check|apply` skill for prerequisite verification.
