## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **Initial release.** Three discipline correctors sharing one re-anchor / audit /
  correct-forward method at plugin scope
  (`context/re-anchor-audit-correct.md`):
  - `/re-anchor:do-your-research` — research and no-assumptions discipline, with a
    `deep` action that fans out fresh-context subagents to verify every load-bearing
    claim.
  - `/re-anchor:follow-our-standards` — alignment to the consuming organization's
    engineering conventions, with relevance-routed progressive loading and respect
    for a declared managed / locally-owned seam.
  - `/re-anchor:point-dont-copy` — pointer-over-copy discipline: no copied content,
    internal-name coupling, or closed capability lists; duplication threshold of two.
- Repo-agnostic and machine-agnostic: each corrector re-anchors the discipline the
  consuming project declares in its own instruction layer, and degrades to a portable
  baseline when none is declared.
