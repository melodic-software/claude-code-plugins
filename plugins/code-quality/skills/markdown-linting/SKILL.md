## Overview

This tooling enables enforcement of strict markdown quality standards through automated linting. Markdown files can be validated using `markdownlint-cli2` with a unified tooling approach that ensures zero configuration drift across VS Code, CLI, and CI/CD environments.

**Core Philosophy:**

- Single source of truth: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` contains all configuration (rules, ignores, options)
- Unified tooling: Same `markdownlint-cli2` engine everywhere (VS Code, CLI, CI/CD)
- Strict enforcement: Fix content to comply with rules, not rules to accommodate content
- Quality-first: Linting rules are intentional and enforce documentation quality

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:

- User encounters markdown linting errors (MD001, MD013, MD033, etc.)
- User asks about markdown validation, formatting, or quality standards
- User needs to configure `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` (rules, ignores, or options)
- User asks about configuration file setup or structure
- User wants to set up VS Code markdown linting extension
- User needs to troubleshoot markdown linting issues
- User asks how to run markdown linting locally
- User wants to understand GitHub Actions markdown validation
- User is working with markdown files and needs quality guidance

## First Use: Installation and Setup

**If this is your first time setting up markdown linting**, see the comprehensive installation guide:

**[Installation and Setup Guide](references/installation-setup.md)**

This guide covers:

- Prerequisites (Node.js/npm)
- Detection of existing setup
- Two approaches: npx (zero setup) vs local install (full features)
- Configuration file creation (`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`)
- Configuring rules, ignores, and options in one file
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting setup issues

**Quick detection check:**

```bash
# Check if you're already set up
ls .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc     # Configuration exists?
npm list markdownlint-cli2      # Package installed?
cat package.json | grep "lint:md"  # Scripts configured?
```

If any of these are missing, follow the [Installation and Setup Guide](references/installation-setup.md) first.

## Quick Start

**Option 1: Using npx (zero setup required):**

```bash
# Check all markdown files
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"

# Auto-fix issues
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" --fix
```

**Option 2: Using npm scripts (if configured):**

```bash
# Check all markdown files for linting errors
npm run lint:md

# Auto-fix fixable linting issues
npm run lint:md:fix
```

**Option 3: VS Code extension for real-time linting (optional/advanced):**

1. Install `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint` from VS Code marketplace
2. Create `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` configuration (see installation guide)
3. Linting happens as you type with auto-fix on save enabled (if configured)

## Unified Tooling Architecture

When configured, `markdownlint-cli2` can be used everywhere to ensure zero configuration drift:

### Tooling Components

1. **CLI Tool** (`markdownlint-cli2`) - **Core component, use this first**
   - Can be run via npx (zero setup) or local install
   - Used for local validation and pre-commit checks
   - Foundation for all other integrations

2. **VS Code Extension** (`davidanson.vscode-markdownlint`) - **Optional/Advanced**
   - Uses same `markdownlint-cli2` engine as CLI
   - Real-time linting as you type
   - Auto-fix on save and paste (configurable in `.vscode/settings.json`)
   - See [VS Code Extension Setup](references/vscode-extension-setup.md)

3. **GitHub Actions** (`markdownlint-cli2-action`) - **Optional/Advanced**
   - Same engine as VS Code and CLI
   - Runs automatically on PRs that modify markdown files (when configured)
   - Same rules as local development (no surprises)
   - See [GitHub Actions Configuration](references/github-actions-config.md)

### Configuration Source

All tools read `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` in the project root as the single source of truth:

```jsonc
{
  "gitignore": true,
  "ignores": ["vendor/**/*.md"],
  "config": {
    "default": true,
    "MD013": false
  }
}
```

**What this contains:**

- `gitignore`: Automatically excludes files from `.gitignore`
- `ignores`: Additional glob patterns to exclude from linting
- `config`: Linting rules (all defaults enabled, MD013 disabled for long lines)

**Configuration precedence** (in decreasing order):

1. `.markdownlint-cli2.{jsonc,yaml,cjs}` file - **Single source of truth**
2. VS Code user/workspace settings (avoid - not portable)
3. Default configuration

**Note:** Changes to `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` apply instantly to all tools (VS Code, CLI, GitHub Actions)

## CRITICAL: Configuration Policy

**IMPORTANT - Read this before modifying any configuration:**

### Strict Policy - Never Modify Without Approval

- **DO NOT modify `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` without explicit approval**
- Strict linting rules are intentional and enforce documentation quality
- If linting errors occur, **fix the content to comply with the rules**, NOT the rules themselves
- Only request rule changes if there is a **compelling architectural reason**
- When in doubt, **ask before relaxing any linting rules**

### Why This Policy Exists

1. **Quality enforcement**: Linting rules maintain documentation consistency and professionalism
2. **Best practices**: Rules encode markdown best practices accumulated over years
3. **Accessibility**: Many rules improve screen reader and markdown parser compatibility
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent formatting makes documentation easier to maintain
5. **Collaboration**: Shared standards reduce friction in code reviews

### Proper Response to Linting Errors

**Correct approach:**

```markdown
Error: MD022/blanks-around-headings - Headings should be surrounded by blank lines

Action: Add blank lines before and after the heading in the markdown file
```

**Incorrect approach:**

```markdown
Error: MD022/blanks-around-headings - Headings should be surrounded by blank lines

Action: Disable MD022 rule in .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc
```

**Exception:** If you genuinely believe a rule should be modified, present your case to the user with:

- The specific rule and why it's problematic
- Examples of where it causes issues
- Architectural or usability rationale
- Proposed configuration change

The user will make the final decision on whether to modify the configuration.

## Running Linting Locally

### CRITICAL: Auto-Fix Workflow

**When running linting validation, ALWAYS automatically fix ALL errors (both fixable and "unfixable") without asking for user confirmation.**

**Workflow:**

1. Run linting validation command (npx or npm scripts)
2. If errors are found:
   - **IMMEDIATELY run the auto-fix command** (`--fix` flag) without prompting
   - Report what was auto-fixed
   - **For any remaining "unfixable" errors:**
     - Read the affected files to understand context
     - Analyze the error and surrounding content
     - Apply intelligent fixes based on context (see "Intelligent Fix Handling" below)
     - Re-run linting to verify fixes
3. If no errors are found, report success

**DO NOT ask "Would you like me to auto-fix?" or "Would you like me to investigate?" - just fix everything automatically.**

### Prerequisites

**For npx approach (zero setup):**

- Node.js 18+ and npm 8+ installed
- No additional setup required

**For local install approach:**

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install
```

If your project doesn't have `markdownlint-cli2` installed, see the [Installation and Setup Guide](references/installation-setup.md).

### Check All Markdown Files

**With npx:**

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
```

**With npm scripts (if configured):**

```bash
npm run lint:md
```

**What this does:**

- Runs `markdownlint-cli2` against all `.md` files in the project
- Automatically excludes `node_modules` directory
- Outputs errors with file paths and line numbers
- Exit code 0 if no errors, non-zero if errors found

**Example output:**

```text
docs/setup-guide.md:45:1 MD022/blanks-around-headings Headings should be surrounded by blank lines
README.md:12:81 MD009/no-trailing-spaces Trailing spaces
```

### Auto-Fix Fixable Issues

**With npx:**

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" --fix
```

**With npm scripts (if configured):**

```bash
npm run lint:md:fix
```

**What this does:**

- Automatically fixes issues that can be safely corrected
- Modifies files in place
- Reports remaining unfixable issues

**Fixable issues include:**

- Trailing spaces (MD009)
- Missing blank lines (MD012, MD022)
- List marker consistency (MD004, MD007)
- Code fence style (MD048)

**Non-fixable issues require intelligent analysis and manual fixes:**

- Heading structure (MD001, MD025)
- Duplicate headings (MD024)
- Line length (MD013, if enabled)
- Link references (MD051, MD052)

### Intelligent Fix Handling

**When "unfixable" errors remain after auto-fix, automatically analyze and fix them.**

For detailed strategies on handling each error type, see the dedicated guide:

**[Intelligent Fixing Guide](references/intelligent-fixing-guide.md)**

This guide covers:

- MD024 - Duplicate Headings (context-aware renaming or removal)
- MD001/MD025 - Heading Structure (hierarchy fixes)
- MD051/MD052 - Link References (anchor and reference link corrections)
- MD013 - Line Length (intelligent wrapping)
- General principles for context-aware analysis
- Verification and reporting best practices
- Performance optimization with parallel Task agents

**Quick summary:**

1. Run auto-fix first: `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" --fix`
2. For remaining errors, read affected files to understand context
3. Apply intelligent fixes based on error patterns (see guide)
4. Always re-run linting to verify all errors are resolved
5. Report what was fixed and how

## VS Code Extension Setup (Optional/Advanced)

**For VS Code integration**, see the dedicated guide:

**[VS Code Extension Setup Guide](references/vscode-extension-setup.md)**

The VS Code extension (`davidanson.vscode-markdownlint`) provides real-time linting in your editor. The guide covers:

- Extension installation and verification
- Auto-fix configuration (format on save, format on paste)
- Interactive linting features (squiggly underlines, quick fixes)
- Keyboard shortcuts for all fix methods
- Configuration precedence and troubleshooting
- Best practices for team usage

**This is optional but highly recommended for regular markdown work.**

## GitHub Actions Integration (Optional/Advanced)

**For CI/CD integration**, see the dedicated guide:

**[GitHub Actions Configuration Guide](references/github-actions-config.md)**

GitHub Actions can automatically validate markdown files on PRs and pushes. The guide covers:

- Complete workflow file configuration
- Trigger setup (PR and push events with path filtering)
- Action versions (checkout@v5, markdownlint-cli2-action@v21)
- Workflow execution flow and results interpretation
- Viewing and fixing CI failures
- Advanced configuration (custom globs, auto-fix, branch protection)
- Troubleshooting common issues

**This is optional but highly recommended for team projects.**

## Customizing Rules (Requires Approval)

**WARNING: Only modify with explicit approval per policy above.**

**For detailed rule information**, see the comprehensive guide:

**[Markdownlint Rules Reference](references/markdownlint-rules.md)**

The rules reference covers:

- All 60+ MD rules with descriptions and examples
- Rule categories (auto-fixable vs manual-fix required)
- Configuration syntax for customizing rules
- Common rule modifications (disable, configure parameters)
- Inline comment syntax for per-file overrides
- Links to official documentation for each rule

**Quick syntax reminder:**

```json
{
  "default": true,        // Enable all defaults
  "MD013": false,         // Disable specific rule
  "MD033": {              // Configure with options
    "allowed_elements": ["br"]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues and solutions:**

### Issue: "Command not found: markdownlint-cli2"

**Solution:** Run `npm install` or use npx: `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"`

### Issue: Too many linting errors to fix manually

**Solution:**

1. Run auto-fix: `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" --fix`
2. Fix remaining errors in batches
3. See [Installation Guide](references/installation-setup.md) for detailed troubleshooting

### Issue: VS Code or GitHub Actions problems

## Multi-Model Testing Notes

**Tested with**:

- **Claude Sonnet**: Optimal performance, follows hub architecture well
- **Claude Haiku**: (To be tested - should work given explicit instructions)
- **Claude Opus**: (To be tested - may over-analyze, content is appropriately scoped)

**Observations**: Skill's explicit command examples and clear decision trees should work well across all model tiers.
