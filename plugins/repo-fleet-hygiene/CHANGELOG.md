## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Read-only fleet discovery across explicit repositories and bounded repository-tree roots.
- Git-native canonical checkout resolution with explicit/configured overrides.
- Per-repository GitHub merged-PR evidence with local-tip drift detection.
- Worktree porcelain parsing, missing/prunable registration reporting, and actual-versus-expected
  common-directory mismatch detection.
- GitHub transfer/rename detection by comparing the configured remote identity with the REST result's
  canonical `full_name`; hard 404/403/network failures remain unknown.
- Fail-closed canonical-identity and worktree-inventory gates that prevent unrelated local evidence or
  a failed attachment query from producing a cleanup candidate.
- Control-safe report rendering: newline/ANSI-bearing paths are encoded as one field and cannot forge
  finding, confidence, or handoff lines.
- Confidence-tiered reports, exact non-destructive handoffs, setup/config documentation, contract
  tests, model evals, and a plugin-acceptance security review.
