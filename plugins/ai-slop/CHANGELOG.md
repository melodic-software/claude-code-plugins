# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: `audit` skill (read-only default, explicit `fix` action), `setup` skill,
  deterministic detector with the mechanical rule roster, judgment rubric, and the
  Signs-of-AI-writing catalog (revision-pinned, CC BY-SA 4.0).
- Hardened by the first dogfood run (pre-release, folded in): ignore markers must be
  well-formed comment markers, not prose mentions — a document that documents the markers no
  longer exempts itself, and a mid-file `ai-slop-ignore-file` declines the whole file instead
  of silently truncating the scan; declined files are named in output (`Declined:` rows with
  cause), not just counted; `emit-findings.sh` composes the findings file deterministically
  from detector output (the model resolves the destination and the contract gate; the script
  owns row assembly at repo scale), writing coverage-only files on zero findings and refusing
  non-detector input.
- Fix guidance: `rule-of-three` rewrites collapse toward the single strongest item unless
  every element is load-bearing.
