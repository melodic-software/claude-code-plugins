# Changelog

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **The fingerprint module, the plugin's one pure library.** Word 5-shingles,
  containment, Jaccard, and contiguous matched spans between a local passage and an
  already-fetched source, behind a thin CLI. It decides nothing: it reports lexical overlap and
  the audit flow maps that evidence to a tier.

  Two behaviors are contract rather than implementation detail, both earned in the spike phase.
  Quotation stripping runs inside the module over the local text before shingling and covers
  inline quotation marks (straight and curly) as well as blockquotes and code fences, because a
  properly quoted and cited excerpt must not read as a copy and a rubric-layer carve-out arrives
  too late. Verdicts are matched spans carrying local line offsets, because whole-file
  containment diluted a real 27-word match to 0.019 on a 2,912-shingle file; the separation rule
  fires on either measure, and the spans are what a fix edits against.

  Written test-first: 21 cases, red before the module existed, with the two amendment fixtures
  named in the output (an inline-quoted excerpt that must strip to zero matched spans, and a
  real-sized file whose planted span must surface while its ratio goes to noise). An unpaired
  quotation mark is left in place rather than swallowing the rest of the line, and a
  word-internal apostrophe is not treated as a quote. The `.test.sh` wrapper exists because CI
  discovers only `*.test.sh`; without it the module would ship with no CI coverage.

- **Plugin scaffold and registration.** Manifest, README, and marketplace entry for the
  documentation-provenance audit: prose in tracked markdown that restates an externally-owned
  fact without a pointer or a conforming stamped record.

  The README carries the boundary against every adjacent owner, the config schema, the fence and
  stamped-record marker forms, and the prerequisites, including what the audit still does when web
  search is unavailable (breadcrumb-only resolution, with the rest landing on the neutral
  `not-found` disposition). The skills, scripts, rubric, and evals land in later phases; the
  contract they build against is `docs/topics/copied-external-content/PLAN.md` and its `design/`
  artifacts.

  The rubric catalog is versioned with this plugin, so a criterion or carve-out change lands here
  and invalidates any golden-set measurement pinned to the prior version.
