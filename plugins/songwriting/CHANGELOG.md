# Changelog

All notable changes to the `songwriting` plugin are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this plugin uses semantic versioning.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- **`setup` skill — re-runnable configuration action.** `/songwriting:setup` scaffolds project-level
  prompt-template overrides under `songwriting/templates/pat-pattison/` from the bundled defaults and
  confirms where craft artifacts land, satisfying the extensibility contract's "every configurable
  plugin ships a setup action". It reads existing overrides first (idempotent), scaffolds only the
  templates the consumer intends to customize (an override freezes that template against future
  plugin improvements), offers to remove byte-identical overrides, and reads — never writes — the
  consumer's own `CLAUDE.md` layout convention. Additive: no existing invocation changes.

## [0.2.0]

### Changed (breaking)

- **Decomposed the `pat-pattison` mega-skill by concern.** The single lyric-craft skill is replaced
  by focused concern skills: `workflow`, `rhyme`, `object-writing`, `meter-prosody`, `song-form`,
  `co-write`, `diagnosis`, and `daily-practice`. Each is a thin router over the shared reference
  corpus and runs the applicable response-filter section as its pre-flight. The `suno` skill is
  unchanged.
  - **Invocation change:** `/songwriting:pat-pattison <action>` is removed. Use the concern skill
    that owns the action — e.g. `/songwriting:rhyme`, `/songwriting:meter-prosody meter`,
    `/songwriting:diagnosis audit`. `/songwriting:workflow` is the start-here situation router and
    carries the full cross-skill routing index and Quick Decision Guide.
- **Reference content is preserved, not lost.** All 48 research files, 16 templates, the Datamuse
  script, and the response filter moved verbatim to `context/pat-pattison/`, keeping every
  intra-corpus link intact.

### Design decision — concern-as-skill, author-as-context

The decomposition separates two independent axes: **concern** (the craft topic → the skill you
invoke) and **author/method** (whose opinionated technique → a content namespace). Pat Pattison's
full method now lives once under `context/pat-pattison/`; the concern skills are author-neutral
interfaces that load it. A future author's method for the same concern plugs in at
`context/<author>/` without modifying the concern skills (open for extension, closed for
modification). This is why the corpus is namespaced by author rather than sitting in a plain
`context/` pool.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: `pat-pattison` lyric-craft skill (all four books plus Berklee/Coursera materials,
  action router, mandatory response filter) and `suno` Suno v5.5 prompt-engineering skill.
