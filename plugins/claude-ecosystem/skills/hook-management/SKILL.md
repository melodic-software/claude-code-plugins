# Hooks Meta Skill

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Invoke docs-management First

> **STOP - Before providing ANY response about Claude Code hooks:**
>
> 1. **INVOKE** `docs-management` skill
> 2. **QUERY** using keywords: hooks, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, hook events, hook configuration, or related topics
> 3. **BASE** all responses EXCLUSIVELY on official documentation loaded
>
> **Skipping this step results in outdated or incorrect information.**

### Verification Checkpoint

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Did I invoke docs-management skill?
- [ ] Did official documentation load?
- [ ] Is my response based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, STOP and invoke docs-management first.

## Overview

Central authority for managing Claude Code hooks in this repository. Automates enforcement of critical repository rules that were previously manual in CLAUDE.md.

**Architecture:** Vertical slice organization with externalized configuration, multi-language support, immediate config reload, and comprehensive testing.

## When to Use This Skill

**Keywords:** hooks, hook management, automation, validation, enforcement, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionEnd, hook configuration, plugin hooks, local hooks

**Use this skill when:**

- Adding new hooks to the repository
- Modifying existing hook behavior
- Troubleshooting hook issues
- Disabling/enabling hooks
- Understanding what hooks are active
- Configuring hook enforcement levels

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Official Hooks Documentation

**For ALL Claude Code hooks capabilities, configuration patterns, and syntax, you MUST use the docs-management skill.**

### What to Delegate to docs-management

**ALWAYS use docs-management for:**

- Hook events reference (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart, SessionEnd, etc.)
- Hook configuration syntax
- Matchers and tool names
- Decision control (allow, deny, ask, block, approve)
- Exit codes and their meanings
- JSON output schemas
- Environment variables ($CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, etc.)
- Command vs prompt-based hooks
- Plugin hooks integration

**Keywords for docs-management searches:**

- "PreToolUse hook configuration"
- "PostToolUse hook examples"
- "SessionEnd hook"
- "hook matchers tool names"
- "hook decision control"
- "hook exit codes"
- "hook JSON output schema"

### What This Skill Provides

**Organization-specific implementation:**

- Directory structure and conventions
- Configuration management patterns
- Shared utilities (json, path, git, config helpers)
- Active hooks inventory
- Multi-language implementation strategy
- Troubleshooting for this repository's hooks

## Quick Decision Tree

**What do you want to do?**

1. **Understand design principles** → See [Design Principles](references/architecture/design-principles.md)
2. **View active hooks** → See [Active Hooks](references/inventory/active-hooks.md)
3. **Manage hook lifecycle** (enable/disable/modify) → See [Hook Lifecycle](references/inventory/hook-lifecycle.md)
4. **Configure hooks** → See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration/hook-config-guide.md)
5. **Create new hook** → See [Creating Hooks Workflow](references/development/creating-hooks-workflow.md)
6. **Test hooks** → See [Testing Guide](references/development/testing-guide.md)
7. **Follow best practices** → See [Best Practices](references/development/best-practices.md)
8. **Troubleshoot issues** → See [Common Issues](references/troubleshooting/common-issues.md)
9. **Debug hooks** → See [Debugging Guide](references/troubleshooting/debugging-guide.md)
10. **Official hooks documentation** → Use docs-management skill with keywords above
11. **Create/configure plugin hooks** → Use `plugin-development` skill (see below)

### Plugin Hooks Delegation

**If you're working with plugin hooks** (hooks bundled in a Claude Code plugin), use the `plugin-development` skill instead. Plugin hooks use a different configuration pattern:

| Aspect | Local Hooks (this skill) | Plugin Hooks |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Location | `.claude/hooks/` directory | Plugin `hooks/hooks.json` |
| Configuration | YAML files (`config.yaml`) | Environment variables |
| Consumer Control | Edit config files directly | Via `settings.json` `env` section |

**For plugin hooks:** Invoke `plugin-development` skill and see the Plugin Hook Configuration section.

## Reference Loading Guide

**All references in this skill are conditional load** - they are loaded only when needed based on the workflow you're following.

### When to Load Each Reference

**Architecture References** (load when understanding design):

- `references/architecture/design-principles.md` → When understanding vertical slice, DRY, config-over-hardcoding principles
- `references/architecture/multi-language-strategy.md` → When implementing or migrating to Python/TypeScript

**Inventory References** (load when working with hooks):

- `references/inventory/active-hooks.md` → When reviewing what hooks are active and their configurations
- `references/inventory/hook-lifecycle.md` → When enabling/disabling hooks or changing enforcement modes

**Configuration References** (load when configuring):

- `references/configuration/hook-config-guide.md` → When modifying global.yaml or config.yaml files

**Development References** (load when creating/testing):

- `references/development/creating-hooks-workflow.md` → When creating a new hook from scratch
- `references/development/testing-guide.md` → When writing tests for hooks
- `references/development/best-practices.md` → When ensuring code quality and following patterns

**Troubleshooting References** (load when debugging):

- `references/troubleshooting/common-issues.md` → When encountering problems (hook not running, config not applying, etc.)
- `references/troubleshooting/debugging-guide.md` → When performing advanced debugging or profiling

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

#### Layer 1: Always in Context

- SKILL.md (this file) - Navigation hub and decision trees

#### Layer 2: Load on Demand

- Reference files based on specific workflow or task

#### Layer 3: External Delegation

- Official documentation via `docs-management` skill queries (always)

This architecture ensures optimal token efficiency while maintaining comprehensive
guidance coverage.

## Active Hooks Summary

For complete details, see [Active Hooks Reference](references/inventory/active-hooks.md).

### PreToolUse Hooks (Validation Before Execution)

1. **prevent-backup-files** - Blocks .bak/.backup file creation for git-tracked content
2. **require-gpg-signing** - Blocks git commits with --no-gpg-sign flag
3. **require-explicit-commit** - Asks approval for direct git commits (encourages git-commit skill)
4. **block-absolute-paths** - Blocks absolute paths in markdown files for portability

### PostToolUse Hooks (Auto-Fix After Execution)

1. **markdown-lint** - Auto-fixes markdown files using markdownlint-cli2

## Configuration Quick Reference

### Master Control

**Disable ALL hooks:**

Edit `.claude/hooks/config/global.yaml`:

```yaml
enabled: false
```

Changes take effect immediately on next hook execution.

### Per-Hook Control

**Disable specific hook:**

Edit `.claude/hooks/<hook-name>/config.yaml`:

```yaml
enabled: false
```

**Change enforcement level:**

```yaml
enforcement: warn  # Options: block, warn, log
```

Changes take effect immediately on next hook execution.

For complete configuration guide, see [Configuration Reference](references/configuration/hook-config-guide.md).

```

**Key principles:**

- **High cohesion:** All hook code, config, docs, and tests in one directory
- **Low coupling:** Hooks don't depend on each other
- **Easy to modify:** Changes isolated to single directory
- **Clear ownership:** One directory = one feature

For complete architecture details, see [Design Principles](references/architecture/design-principles.md).

## Shared Utilities Quick Reference

All hooks have access to these shared helper functions:

- **json-utils.sh** - JSON parsing and output (requires jq)
- **path-utils.sh** - Path manipulation and pattern matching
- **git-utils.sh** - Git command detection and validation
- **config-utils.sh** - Config loading with hot reload support
- **test-helpers.sh** - Test assertion framework

For usage examples, see [Best Practices](references/development/best-practices.md).

## Common Workflows

### Quick Actions

**Disable all hooks temporarily:**

```bash
# Edit .claude/hooks/config/global.yaml
enabled: false
```

**View hook activity:**

```bash
# Edit .claude/hooks/config/global.yaml
log_level: debug
```

**Run all tests:**

```bash
bash .claude/hooks/test-runner.sh
```

**Test specific hook:**

```bash
bash .claude/hooks/<hook-name>/tests/integration.test.sh
```

**Test manually:**

```bash
echo '{"tool": "Write", "file_path": "test.txt"}' | \
  bash .claude/hooks/<hook-name>/bash/<hook-name>.sh
```
