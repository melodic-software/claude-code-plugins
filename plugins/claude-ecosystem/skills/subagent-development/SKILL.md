## Official YAML Frontmatter Reference

**Source:** `doc_id: code-claude-com-docs-en-sub-agents` section `#configuration-fields`

These are the officially documented YAML frontmatter fields for subagent definition files:

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens |
| `description` | Yes | Natural language description of the subagent's purpose |
| `tools` | No | Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from main thread |
| `model` | No | Model alias (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) or `'inherit'` to use main conversation's model |
| `permissionMode` | No | Valid values: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`, `ignore` |
| `skills` | No | Comma-separated list of skill names to auto-load when subagent starts |

**Important:** The `color` property documented below is NOT in official Claude Code documentation.

## Color Property (Undocumented)

The `color` property is an undocumented feature that sets the UI color for subagents. It is NOT in official Claude Code documentation and may change without notice.

**Available Values:** red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan

**Placement:** Typically placed after `model` or at the bottom of YAML frontmatter.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: Description of what this agent does
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: haiku
color: blue
---
```

**Warning:** As an undocumented feature, this property:

- May not work in all Claude Code versions
- May be removed or changed without notice
- Should not be relied upon for critical functionality

## Repository Color Standard

This repository uses a semantic color categorization for subagents to provide visual consistency:

### Category Assignments

| Category | Color | Purpose | Agents |
| -------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| **Documentation/Meta** | purple | Documentation, auditing, meta-skills | docs-researcher, docs-validator, skill-auditor |
| **Code Quality** | blue | Code analysis, review, debugging, testing | code-reviewer, codebase-analyst, debugger, test-generator |
| **Research** | green | Research, information gathering, web content | mcp-research, platform-docs-researcher, web-research |

### Reserved Colors (Future Use)

| Color | Reserved For |
| ----- | ------------ |
| orange | Generation/Creation agents |
| red | Critical/Error handling agents |
| yellow | Warning/Attention agents |
| pink | User-facing/Communication agents |
| cyan | Utility agents |

### When to Assign Colors

When creating new agents for this repository:

1. **Identify the agent's primary purpose** (documentation, code quality, research, etc.)
2. **Match to existing category** if possible
3. **Use reserved colors** only for new categories that match the reserved purpose
4. **Document new categories** if creating a genuinely new type

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "agent file format", "agent YAML frontmatter"
3. Load official documentation
4. Provide guidance based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs
```

### Multi-Topic Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "I want to create an agent with restricted tools that uses Haiku"

1. Invoke docs-management skill with multiple queries:
   - "agent file format", "agent YAML frontmatter"
   - "agent tools", "allowed-tools agents"
   - "agent model selection", "haiku agents"
2. Synthesize guidance from official documentation
```

### Troubleshooting Pattern

```text
User reports: "My agent isn't being invoked automatically"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "automatic delegation agents", "agent description"
3. Check official docs for automatic invocation requirements
4. Guide user based on official troubleshooting steps
```
