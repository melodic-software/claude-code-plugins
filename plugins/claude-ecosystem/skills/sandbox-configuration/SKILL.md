description: Central authority for Claude Code sandboxing and isolation. Covers sandboxed bash tool, /sandbox command, filesystem isolation (blocked access, custom paths), network isolation (domain restrictions, proxy support), OS-level enforcement (bubblewrap on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS), sandbox configuration options, escape hatches (dangerouslyDisableSandbox, allowUnsandboxedCommands), and sandbox security limitations. Assists with configuring sandbox settings, understanding isolation mechanisms, and troubleshooting sandbox issues. Delegates 100% to docs-management skill for official documentation.

# Sandbox Configuration Skill

## MANDATORY: Invoke docs-management First

> **STOP - Before providing ANY response about Claude Code sandboxing:**
>
> 1. **INVOKE** `docs-management` skill
> 2. **QUERY** for the user's specific topic
> 3. **BASE** all responses EXCLUSIVELY on official documentation loaded
>
> **Skipping this step results in outdated or incorrect information.**

### Verification Checkpoint

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Did I invoke docs-management skill?
- [ ] Did official documentation load?
- [ ] Is my response based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, STOP and invoke docs-management first.
