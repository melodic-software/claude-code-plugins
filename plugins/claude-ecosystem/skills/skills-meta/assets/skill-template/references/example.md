# Example Reference Documentation

This is an example reference file to demonstrate how to organize supporting documentation for skills.

## Purpose

Reference files provide detailed information that Claude can load on-demand when needed, implementing the progressive disclosure pattern.

## When to Use References

Use reference files for:

- Detailed API documentation
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guides
- Specifications and standards
- Extended examples and tutorials

## Structure Best Practices

**Keep references one level deep** - Don't nest references beyond one level from SKILL.md. Claude reads complete files when directly referenced from SKILL.md, but may only preview nested references.

**For large reference files (>100 lines):** Include a table of contents at the top so Claude understands available information during partial reads.

## Example Content

This file would contain detailed information relevant to your skill. Replace this content with actual documentation for your specific use case.
