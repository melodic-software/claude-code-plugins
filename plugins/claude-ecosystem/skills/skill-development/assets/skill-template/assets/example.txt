Example Asset Template File

This file demonstrates how to organize assets within a skill.

Assets are files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather
used within the output Claude produces. Examples include:

- Template files (.txt, .json, .yaml, .xml)
- Boilerplate code structures
- Document templates (.md, .html)
- Images, icons, fonts (if applicable)
- Configuration examples

Replace this file with actual assets relevant to your skill.

For example, if your skill generates configuration files, you might
include a configuration template here that Claude can reference when
creating new configurations for users.
