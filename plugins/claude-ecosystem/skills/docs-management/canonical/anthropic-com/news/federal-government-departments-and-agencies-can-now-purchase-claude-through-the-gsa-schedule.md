# Federal government departments and agencies can now purchase Claude through the GSA schedule

Aug 5, 2025

Claude is now available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, making it easier for all U.S. federal government departments and agencies to quickly access Claude, with pre-negotiated pricing and terms that comply with federal acquisition regulations.

Our commitment to responsible AI deployment, including rigorous safety testing, collaborative governance development, and strict usage policies, has made Claude uniquely suited for public sector and national security applications. And now, government agencies can more easily transform how they work, all while still meeting federal security and compliance requirements.

We will continue to work with our partners across the government to expand Claude access for federal teams by streamlining procurement processes and offering unique pricing.

**Growing government partnerships**

The deployment of AI across federal agencies enhances productivity, streamlines operations, and enables more effective and responsive government services. This partnership with GSA enables us to help government organizations harness the power of AI to modernize operations.

Anthropic has recently announced partnerships with [national laboratories](https://www.anthropic.com/news/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory-expands-claude-for-enterprise-to-empower-scientists-and) for scientific research, integration into defense and intelligence workflows through technology partners, and [custom Claude Gov models](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-gov-models-for-u-s-national-security-customers) designed specifically for national security applications.

**Get started**
