# Claude is now generally available in Xcode

Sep 15, 2025

Developers can now connect their Claude account to Xcode 26 to power coding intelligence features with Claude Sonnet 4. Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) and offers the tools you need to develop, test, and distribute apps for Apple platforms. This integration lets developers use Claude's coding capabilities directly in their workflow, accelerating app development for Apple platforms.

## Using Claude in Xcode

When you log into your Claude account in Xcode, you’ll have access to coding intelligence features powered by Claude Sonnet 4:

* **Coding assistant**: Interact with your code using natural language. Claude automatically gathers context from your project and supports conversation history and file attachments to help you debug, refactor, and build features
* **Coding Tools**: Generate documentation for your code, get explanations of highlighted sections, create SwiftUI previews and playgrounds, and make inline code changes directly in your editor

Your Claude subscription usage limits are shared across platforms, with a portion available through Xcode.

## Getting started

To start using Claude in Xcode:

1. Download [Xcode 26](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac App Store
2. Open Xcode preferences and navigate to the Intelligence settings
3. Log in with your Claude account
