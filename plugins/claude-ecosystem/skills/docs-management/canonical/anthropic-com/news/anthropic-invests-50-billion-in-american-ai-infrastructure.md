Today, we are announcing a $50 billion investment in American computing infrastructure, building data centers with [Fluidstack](https://www.fluidstack.io/) in Texas and New York, with more sites to come. These facilities are custom built for Anthropic with a focus on maximizing efficiency for our workloads, enabling continued research and development at the frontier.

The project will create approximately 800 permanent jobs and 2,400 construction jobs, with sites coming online throughout 2026. It will help advance the goals in the Trump administration’s [AI Action Plan](https://www.ai.gov/action-plan) to maintain American AI leadership and strengthen domestic technology infrastructure. We are proud to create good American jobs and bolster American competitiveness.

“We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before. Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier,” said Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic. “These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs."

Anthropic's trajectory is driven by our talent-dense technical team, our focus on safety, and our frontier research, including pioneering alignment and interpretability work. Every day more businesses, developers, and power users are trusting Claude to help them solve their most challenging problems. Anthropic serves more than 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly sevenfold in the past year.

We selected Fluidstack as our partner for its ability to move with exceptional agility, enabling rapid delivery of gigawatts of power. “Fluidstack was built for this moment,” said Gary Wu, co-founder and CEO of Fluidstack. "We're proud to partner with frontier AI leaders like Anthropic to accelerate and deploy the infrastructure necessary to realize their vision."

The scale of this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for Claude from hundreds of thousands of businesses while keeping our research at the frontier. We’ll continue to prioritize cost-effective, capital-efficient approaches to achieving this scale as our growth continues.
