# Rahul Patil joins Anthropic as Chief Technology Officer

Oct 7, 2025

We're excited to announce that Rahul Patil has joined Anthropic as our Chief Technology Officer. Rahul will oversee our engineering organization across product, compute, infrastructure, inference, data science, and security as we scale Claude to meet growing enterprise demand worldwide.

Rahul brings over 20 years of experience building and maintaining industry-leading infrastructure for businesses. Most recently, he served as CTO of Stripe, where he guided the technical organization supporting millions of businesses processing more than trillion dollars annually. Prior to Stripe, Rahul held senior engineering leadership roles at AWS, Microsoft, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, developing deep expertise in building reliable, scalable mission-critical systems that businesses depend on.

“I'm thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” said Rahul. “Anthropic’s brilliance in both research and products, and their conscientious approach to pushing the boundaries of what's possible feels like the most important work I could be doing right now—I personally can't think of a greater calling and responsibility.”

“Building AI systems that people can trust has been central to our work as we've grown to serve over 300,000 business customers,” said Daniela Amodei, co-founder and President of Anthropic. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling robust infrastructure that businesses can depend on as we work to make Claude the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”

For developers building with Claude, Rahul's appointment signals our commitment to world-class infrastructure and reliability at scale. As part of these changes, Sam McCandlish, one of Anthropic's co-founders and previously CTO, has taken on a new role as Chief Architect. In this role, Sam will deepen his focus on large-scale model training, continuing to lead pretraining while expanding his scope to include research productivity and RL infrastructure.
