The state of Maryland has [announced](https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Governor-Wes-Moore-Announces-Landmark-AI-Partnership-to-Transform-State-Service-Delivery.aspx) it will use Anthropic's advanced AI models to improve government operations and better serve its more than six million residents. Under the new partnership, the state will deploy Claude across multiple state agencies to address several priorities:

* **Connecting families with benefits**: A Claude-powered virtual assistant will help residents apply for essential benefits, including SNAP, Medicaid, temporary cash assistance, and WIC. The new tool will also identify additional programs that residents might qualify for, connecting eligible families to support they might not otherwise have known was available.
* **Helping benefits caseworkers deliver faster support**: Maryland manually processes more than 150,000 documents each month for various assistance programs. Under our new partnership, caseworkers will use Claude to more quickly and accurately verify these documents, validate people’s eligibility, and provide policy guidance for complex cases.
* **Upskilling workers and supporting essential community services**: Maryland will explore an AI upskilling pilot for early-career professionals in Maryland’s [“lighthouse” industries](https://business.maryland.gov/roadmap/) to support the state’s economic priorities. Anthropic will also work with the Governor's Innovation Team on a new tool that uses Claude to identify unmet marketneeds in local communities, like fresh food and childcare, and equips local leaders and organizations with the data, analysis and resources they need to help address these needs.

The partnership builds on Maryland’s existing use of Claude to improve its services. In June, Maryland launched a bilingual Claude-powered chatbot, simplifying information access for more than 600,000 Marylanders receiving SUN Bucks benefits, while reducing call center volume.

Anthropic’s co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei met Maryland Governor Wes Moore this summer to discuss the immense potential for AI to help state governments address issues like getting benefits to those who need them. Our teams, alongside the Rockefeller Foundation and Percepta, have since worked to develop programs that meet Maryland’s needs and can serve as a model for other states across the country.

Anthropic’s commitment to responsible AI deployment, including rigorous safety testing, makes Claude uniquely suited for sensitive government applications like these. Anthropic is pleased to help Maryland translate its [AI governance principles](https://doit.maryland.gov/policies/ai/Pages/maryland-responsible-ai-policy.aspx) into tangible new initiatives that make public services more efficient, accessible, and responsive.
