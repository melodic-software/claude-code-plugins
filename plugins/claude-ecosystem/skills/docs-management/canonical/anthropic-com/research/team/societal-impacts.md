# Societal Impacts

Working closely with the Anthropic Policy and Safeguards teams, Societal Impacts is a technical research team that explores how AI is used in the real world.

### Sociotechnical alignment

Which human values should AI models hold, and how should they operate in the face of conflicting or ambiguous values? How is AI used (and misused) in the wild? How can we anticipate future uses and risks of AI? Societal Impacts researchers develop experiments, training methods, and evaluations to answer these questions.

### Policy relevance

Though the Societal Impacts team is technical, they often pick research questions that have policy relevance. They believe that providing trustworthy research concerning topics policymakers care about will lead to better policy (and overall) outcomes for everyone.

[## Anthropic Economic Index: Tracking AI’s role in the US and global economy

Economic ResearchSep 15, 2025

This report maps how Claude is used differently across US states and countries, finding strong correlations between income and AI adoption. It also tracks a notable shift: directive automation has risen from 27% to 39% of conversations since December 2024, with businesses automating far more than consumers.](/research/economic-index-geography)

#### Anthropic Economic Index: AI’s impact on software development

Comparing Claude Code to Claude.ai reveals stark differences in how developers work with AI. The coding agent shows 79% automation versus 49% on Claude.ai, web development dominates usage, and startups are adopting agentic tools far faster than enterprises—patterns that may preview how AI transforms other occupations.](/research/impact-software-development)[Societal ImpactsApr 21, 2025

#### Values in the wild: Discovering and analyzing values in real-world language model interactions

What values does Claude actually express during real conversations? Analyzing 700,000 interactions, this paper creates the first large-scale empirical taxonomy of AI values and finds that Claude adapts its expressed values to context—mirroring users in most cases, but resisting when core principles are at stake.](/research/values-wild)[PolicyOct 17, 2023

#### Collective Constitutional AI: Aligning a Language Model with Public Input

Anthropic and the Collective Intelligence Project ran a public process with ~1,000 Americans to draft a constitution for an AI system, then trained a model on it.](/research/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input)[Societal ImpactsFeb 15, 2022

#### Predictability and Surprise in Large Generative Models

Large models have predictable loss via scaling laws but unpredictable capabilities. This tension has significant policy implications.](/research/predictability-and-surprise-in-large-generative-models)
