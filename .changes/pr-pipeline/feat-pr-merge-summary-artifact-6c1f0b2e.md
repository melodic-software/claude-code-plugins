### Added

- The pr-merge workflow's merge job uploads each sweep's verdicts as the `pr-merge-summary` artifact
  (30-day retention): the run, the candidate, enqueued, merged and held counts, refusal counts by
  reason with PR numbers and run lists stripped so they aggregate, any gate-budget stop, and the
  per-candidate results. It also logs one `refusal-counts=` line built from that data, so a log
  search finds it once.
