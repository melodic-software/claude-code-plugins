### Changed

- The eval suite moved from `skills/*/evals/evals.json` to `evals/<case>/case.yaml` and `prompt.md`, with deterministic graders where an expectation is mechanical ([#8635](https://github.com/melodic-software/claude-code-plugins/issues/8635)).
- The `verify-api` case now expects no API call without the `verify-api` argument, as the skill says.
