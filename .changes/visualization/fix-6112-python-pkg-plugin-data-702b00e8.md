### Fixed

- **The shared prerequisites checker now finds a `python-pkg` in the plugin's own installed Python
  set.** A module that the interpreter cannot import on its own is looked up in the set a plugin
  with a committed `requirements.txt` installs into its data directory
  (`<data>/python/<lock hash>-<interpreter tag>/`), imported the way that plugin's launcher runs
  it. Before, such a package was reported missing. When the data directory is unknown (no
  `--data-dir`, no `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`), the entry reports `unverified` instead of failing.
  Refs #6112.
