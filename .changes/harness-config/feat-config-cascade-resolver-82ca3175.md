bump: minor

### Added

- Shared `resolve-convention-home.sh` synced: `--ref` (a 40-hex commit id or `origin/<name>`) reads the pointer and the home as committed, `-` reads the region from stdin, a `declined` line in the region exits 4 so the caller does not ask again, and a root that is `$HOME`, an ancestor of it or outside a git work tree exits 5 (not applicable).

### Changed

- With no `--root`, `resolve-convention-home.sh` reads the git toplevel of `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (else of the current directory): one home per git root.

### Fixed

- A `CLAUDE.md` symlinked to `AGENTS.md`, or the reverse, no longer prints a `duplicate:` notice.
